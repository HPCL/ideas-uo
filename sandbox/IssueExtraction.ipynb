    "#### Rate Limiting\n",
    "The API does not allow more than 60 unauthenticated requests per hour (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting) which is problematic for larger repositories (see **Pagination** below). At maximum efficiency, the API retrieves up to 100 results per page on a single call for requesting both issues and comments. Utilizing a person access token for authenticated requests, however, increases this limit to 5000 authenticated requests per hour, which sufficiently handles large repositories (see https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token for setting up a personal access token). GitLab rate limits at 600 requests per minute."

    "In repositories with no more than 100 issues/comments (maximum entries that can be grabbed per page), the API will return all the data on a single call. However, when this limit is exceeded it is necessary to use pagination (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination) and make additional API calls to fetch all the issues/comments for the repository.\n",

    "$I$ = Number of issues in a repository\\\n",
    "$C$ = Number of comments in a repository \\\n",
    "$A(x) =  \\lceil \\frac{x}{100} \\rceil$ is the total number of API calls \\\n",
    "If $I = 1184$, $C = 4862$, then the number of API calls is $A(I) + A(C) = \\lceil \\frac{1184}{100} \\rceil + \\lceil \\frac{4862}{100} \\rceil =  12 + 49 = 61$ which also shows the importance of using authenticated requests. This number can be a little bit larger due to the number of unpaired comments (see **Finding Unpaired Comments** below)."
