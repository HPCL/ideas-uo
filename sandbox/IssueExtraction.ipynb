    "#### Rate Limiting\n",
    "The API does not allow more than 60 unauthenticated requests per hour (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting) which is problematic for larger repositories (see **Pagination** below). At maximum efficiency, the API retrieves up to 100 results per page on a single call for requesting both issues and comments. Utilizing a person access token for authenticated requests, however, increases this limit to 5000 authenticated requests per hour, which sufficiently handles large repositories (see https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token for setting up a personal access token). GitLab rate limits at 600 requests per minute."

This number can be a little bit larger due to the number of unpaired comments (see **Finding Unpaired Comments** below)."
