    These will be used to specify how to install packages and their dependencies,
    as well as to specify restrictions (e.g., on particular versions) for
    dependencies.  e.g.:
    
    class SomePackage(Package):
            depends_on('boost@1.46,1.49')
    
    This would require either of those two versions of boost.
    
    This also moves depends_on out to relations.py and adds
    ""provides"", which will allow packages to provide virtual
    dependences.

    to represent specs.  They're not integrated with packages yet.

    satisfies() really needs to handle dependencies properly.
    
    Implemented support for dependencies in satisfies, but constrain() now
    isn't consistent (as we do not currently constrain deps), so need to

    Virtual dependency support probably needs some deeper thought.  i.e.,
    there is probably an intermediate DAG form that would make the needed
    checks easier.  Right now we have to build ProviderIndexes to figure out
    how virtual dependencies are set up.  If the vdep were preserved in the DAG,
    then we could just check for things like incompatible providers directly.

    The dependency hash wasn't being generated in a consistent way: when
    read from .spec file in the install directory, the spec DAG was not
    normalized, but when generated on install, it was.  Thus the same
    spec can have two possible hashes, which is obviously not good.
    
    In this commit:
    - Added a dep_hash function to spec, which should be used to get the
      dependency hash in all cases.  This function normalizes the spec
      before generating the hash.
    
    - removed sha1 functions from Spec and DependencyHash.  The one on
      Spec is not needed and is confusing (it hashed the whole spec, not
      just hash the deps) and the one on DependencyHash wasn't guaranteed
      to be safe because it can't normalize its parent spec before
      hashing.
    
    Hopefully this makes things consistent and easy.

    - Variant concretization is tricky:
    
      - During concretization, a spec without variants (e.g., mpich) means
        ""don't care"".  So, Spec('mpich').satisfies('mpich+debug') is true
        because it *could* still be built that way.
    
      - After concretization, a spec without a particular variant means
        ""don't know"", as that wasn't part of the spec, so the opposite
        relationship is true.  Assume 'spec' is already installed:
    
          spec.satisfies('mpich+debug')
    
        this is false beacuse the `debug` variant didn't exist when spec
        was built, so we can't satisfy the explicit request for +debug.

6,7,Sunday,2015,0,"    SPACK-38: Allow specs to be indexed by virtual dependencies.
    
    - The following now work differently:
    
          spec['mpi']
          spec['blas']
    
      This can return a spec for openmpi, mpich, mvapich, etc., EVEN if
      the spec is already concretized.  This means that in a package that
      `depends_on('mpi')`, you can do `spec['mpi']` to see what it was
      concretized to.  This should simplify MPI and BLAS packages.
    
          'mpi' in spec
          'blas' in spec
    
      Previously, if the spec had been concretized, these would be `False`
      because there was not a dependency in the DAG with either of these
      names. These will now be `True` even if the spec has been
      concretized.  So, e.g., this will print ""YES""
    
          s = Spec('callpath ^mpich')
          if 'mpi' in spec:
              print ""YES""
    
    - Similarly, this will be True:
    
          Spec('mpich').satisfies('mpi')
    
    - Because of the way virtual dependencies are currently implemented,
      the above required some fiddling around with `package.py` so that it
      would never call `Spec.__contains__` (and result in endless
      recursion).
    
    - This should be fixed by allowing virutal dependnecies to have their
      own package class.
      - This would allow a quicker check for vdeps, without a call to
        `all_packages`.
      - For the time being, `package.py` shouldn't call `__contains__`

    - ProviderIndex.satisfies() was only checking whether the result map
      was non-empty.  It should check whether all common vdeps are *in*
      the result map, as that indicates there is *some* way to satisfy
      *all* of them.  We were checking whether there was some way to
      satisfy *any one* of them, which is wrong.
    
    - Above would cause a problem when there is more than one vdep provider.

12,11,Friday,2015,6,"    Fix #217: Use MUCH faster hashing, reduce number of DAG copies.
    
    This changes the hash algorithm so that it does much less object
    allocation and copying, and so that it is correct.
    
    The old version of `_cmp_key()` would call `sorted_deps`, which would
    call `flat_dependencies` to get a list of dependencies so that it
    could sort them in alphabetical order.  This isn't necessary in the
    `_cmp_key()`, and in fact we want more DAG structure than that to be
    included in the `_cmp_key()`.
    
    The new version constructs a tuple without copying the Spec DAG, and
    the tuple contains hashes of sub-DAGs that are computed recursively
    in-place.  This is way faster than the previous algorithm and reduces
    the numebr of copies significantly. It is also a correct DAG hash.
    
    Example timing and copy counts for the different hashing algorithms
    we've tried:
    
    Original (wrong) Spec hash:
    ```
    106,170 copies
    real    0m5.024s
    user    0m4.949s
    sys     0m0.104s
    ```
    
    Spec hash using YAML `dag_hash()`:
    ```
    3,794 copies
    real    0m5.024s
    user    0m4.949s
    sys     0m0.104s
    
    New no-copy, no-YAML hash:
    ```
    3,594 copies
    real    0m2.543s
    user    0m2.435s
    sys     0m0.104s
    ```
    
    So now we have a hash that is correct AND faster.
    
    The remaining ~3k copies happen mostly during concretization, and as
    all packages are initially loaded.  I believe this is because Spack
    currently has to load all packages to figure out virtual dependency
    information; it could also be becasue there ar a lot of lookups of
    partial specs in concretize.  I can investigate this further.

      a different fetch strategy than the default one for the package.
    
    - This is fixed but fetch/stage/mirror logic is still too complicated
      and long-term needs a rethink.
    
    - Spack will now print a warning when fetching a checksum-less tarball
      from a mirror -- users should be careful to use https or local
      filesystem mirrors for this.

      return links.  We evaluate actual links found in the scraped pages
      instead of trying to reconstruct them naively.

      interprets the name and version in a URL.

12,30,Wednesday,2015,1,"    significant llvm update
    
    This update significantly reworks the llvm and clang packages.  The llvm
    package now includes variants allowing it to build and install any and
    all of:
    
    * clang
    * lldb
    * llvm's libunwind (why, WHY did they name it this?!?)
    * polly (including building it directly into the clang tools, 3.7.0 only)
    * clang extra tools
    * compiler-rt (sanitizers)
    * clang lto (the gold linker plugin that allows same to work)
    * libcxx/libcxxabi
    * libopenmp, also setting the default openmp runtime to same, when
      parameters happen this shoudl be an option of libomp or libgomp
    
    Ideally, this should have rpath setup like the gcc package does, but
    clang's driver has no support for specs as such, and no clearly
    equivalent mechanism either.  If anyone has ideas on this, they would be
    welcome.
    
    One significant note related to gcc though, if you test this on LLNL
    systems, or anywhere that has multiple GCCs straddling the dwarf2
    boundary and sharing a libstdc++, build a gcc with spack and use that to
    build clang.  If you use a gcc4.8+  to build this with an older
    libstdc++ it will fail on missing unwind symbols because of the
    discrepancy.
    
    Resource handling has been changed slightly to move the unpacked archive
    into the target rather than use symlinks, because symlinks break certain
    kinds of relative paths, and orders resource staging such that nested
    resources are unpacked after outer ones.

1,11,Monday,2016,1,"    This commit makes the following changes:
    
    There are two sensible defaults for building boost libraries: build all of them
    or build none of them. Previously the Spack boost package took the first
    approach. This commit changes to building no libraries by default. The user can
    specify which libraries they need using variants (e.g. +iostreams to compile the
    boost iostreams library). If no libraries are built then a header-only install
    is performed (no compilation, just copy header files to prefix). The consequence
    of this change is that packages which specify a dependency on boost may now fail
    (until they are updated to specify exactly which boost libraries they need
    compiled).
    
    The user may now specify whether to build shared libraries (static libraries are
    always built) and whether to build libraries with/out multi-threading support
    (default is to only build with multi-threading support).
    
    The executable on the user-config.jam toolset line is set to Spack's cc script.
    Before, without this, the desired toolset was used but Spack deferred to the
    boost build system to choose the compiler version.
    
    bzip2 and zlib are always specified as dependencies when iostreams is built
    (before this could be controlled with the +compression variant).

I checked several systems to confirm this, and ncurses examples on the web also simply contain ""#include <ncurses.h>"" instead of ""#include <ncurses/ncurses.h>"", which would be necessary to use the currently installed ncurses packages. For example, this also breaks llvm, which uses ncurses, but does not expect the second level of subdirectories.

      and modifies any scripts wtih shebangs that are too long to use
      `sbang` instead.
    
    - `sbang` is at the top level, so it should be runnable (not much we
      can do if spack itself is too deep for shebang)
      - `sbang`, when used as the interpreter, runs the *second* shebang

3,11,Friday,2016,2,"    A new subclass StagedPackage(Package) is introduced.  This PR should
    not change the behavior for existing packages that subclass from
    spack.Package.
    
    If a package subclasses spack.StagedPackage instead of spack.Package,
    the install() phase (run inside a forked process) is now separated
    into sub-stages:
    
        a) spconfig: Generate a script spconfig.py that will configure the
           package (eg by running CMake or ./configure) This is for use if
           the user wishes to build externally from Spack.  Therefore, the
           Spack compiler wrappers are NOT used here.  Currently, that
           means that RPATH support is up to the user.
    
        b) configure: Configure the project (eg: runs configure, CMake,
           etc).  This will configure it for use within Spack, using the
           Spack wrapper.
    
        c) build: eg: ""make""
    
        d) install: eg: ""install""
    
    If one chooses to use StagedPackage instead of Package, then one must
    implement each of the install sub-stages as a separate method.
    StagedPackage.install() then calls each of the sub-stages as
    appropriate.
    
    StagedPackage can be configured to only run certain sub-stages.  This
    is done by setting the optional kwarg install_phases when calling
    do_install().  Setting install_phases() ONLY has an effect on
    StagedPackage, not on any existing packages.  By default,
    install_phases is set to make StagedPackage run the same stages that
    are normally run for any package: configure, build, install (and NOT
    spconfig).
    
    The ability for Spack to run stages selectively for StagedPackage
    instances will enable new functionality.  For example, explicit
    CMake/Autotools helpers that allow Spack to help configure a user's
    project without fetching, building or installing it.
    
    -------------
    
    One implementation of StagedPackage is provided, CMakePackage.  This
    has the following advantage for CMake-based projects over using the
    standard Package class:
    
      a) By separating out the phases, it enables future new functionality
         for packages that use it.
    
      b) It provides an implementation of intall_spconfig(), which will
         help users configure their CMake-based projects.
    
    CMakePackage expects users to implement configure_args() and
    configure_env().  These methods provide the package-specific arguments
    and environment needed to properly configure the package.  They are
    placed in separated functions because they are used in both the
    spconfig and configure stages.
    
    TODO:
    
    1. Generate spconfig.py scripts that are more readable.  This allows
       the users to understand how their project is configured.
    
    2. Provide a practical way for the user to ACCESS the spconfig stage
       without building the project through Spack.
    
    3. The CMAKE_TRANSITIVE_INCLUDE_PATH stuff needs to be reworked; it
       should be considered provisional for now.
    
    4. User of Autotools might wish to make a similar ConfigurePackage
       subclass of StagedPackage.

    One package using CMakePackage is introduced.  See ibmisc/package.py.

    - `_expand_virtual_packages` now gets a candidate list and will try

    that depends on py-numpy. This follows the model of what is done for
    py-setuptools.

       too long in the output, *all* specs would have space padding added
       to that width, and it would look like the output of `spack find`
       was double spaced.  This no longer happens -- the one bad line
       wraps around and the other lines are now single-spaced when you use
       `-v` with boost.

    - Unset variables that were incorrect from the auto guess prefix
      inspections.
    - Add a RemovePath environment_modifications_formats for dotkit.
    - Set the module environment variables appropriate for the different
      variants.
    - Change the component logic so that the '+all' variant works. It was
      getting split by letter and leaving COMPONENTS empty.
    - Added a variant checking function.
    - Added NONRPM_DB_DIR to the silent.cfg so that the product database
      goes to the installation directory.
    - With the product database in prefix the code to remove the product
      database file from the home directory is no longer needed and was
      removed.

    are built with the Spack compiler wrapper. A copy of Makeconf is made
    before `filter_compilers` is called. This is then pointed to by the
    R_MAKEVARS_SITE environment variable set up in
    `setup_dependent_environment`. With this the normal compilers are used
    outside of spack and the spack wrapper compilers are used inside of
    spack.
    
    This commit also standardizes on the `join_path` call. It also sets the
    commented build command to reflect what is actually used with the newer
    string formatting.

    This commit changes the git package to depend_on('perl').  The system
    perl is not always sufficient to install git (e.g. a CentOS7 system with
    the development tools group installed has perl but not the
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker package that git needs) and one can't always update
    the system's perl.

    A platform to generically cover all Cray systems is introduced to avoid having
    specific platforms for each of XK (XE, XT), XC, and future systems using CrayPE
    and CNL.
    
    The platform searches for 'front_end' and 'back_end' targets, in order, from:
    
      * Environment variables 'SPACK_FRONT_END' and 'SPACK_BACK_END'
      * A spack configuration file 'targets.yaml'
      * Parsing `/etc/bash.bashrc.local` for first loaded CrayPE CPU target.
    
    If a back_end target is not found through one of these methods, an exception is
    raised. Otherwise, the back_end is set as the default target. The shell init
    script search is based on recommendations in Crayports case #144359.
    
    No automagic way of determining front_end targets has been found (to date) so if
    a front_end is not specified through configuration, it is ignored which should
    leave a spack instance in a consistant state.

    nor is it mentioned in the source tree.  I *do* have a version in
    /usr/lib64, but ldd does not sure it being linked in either....
    
    By depending on 'ncurses' I can do away with the need for the patch.

    - Created a FileCache for managing user cache files in Spack.  Currently just
      handles virtuals.
    
    - Moved virtual cache from the repository to the home directory so that users do
      not need write access to Spack repositories to use them.
    
    - Refactored `Transaction` class in `database.py` -- moved it to
      `LockTransaction` in `lock.py` and made it reusable by other classes.
    
    Other additions:
    
    - Added tests for file cache and transactions.
    
    - Added a few more tests for database
    
    - Fixed bug in DB where writes could happen even if exceptions were raised
      during a transaction.
    
    - `spack uninstall` now attempts to repair the database when it discovers that a
      prefix doesn't exist but a DB record does.

    - add latest stable release `1.10.0`
    - add previous versions (hashes)
    - add default license header
    - add build options (shamelessly taken from HDF5 package)
    - add validation for excisting FC (as in HDF5) and make optional
    - handle mxml dependency correctly (not required in 1.10.0+)
    - add `CFLAGS=-fPIC` to build shared (python) libs in ADIOS' lib
    - remove `-DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK` since it is normally not required
    - remove `MPICC/CXX?FC` since `--with-mpi` just performs well
    - add transforms:
      - `zlib`: useful (optional) default
      - `szip`: optional (compile often broken)
    - add transports that are not as performant as the `.bp` format:
      - `hdf5`: non-default

    ```
    think you'll find that if you try running something like:
    spack spec libsplash ^hdf5@1.8.15
    It will complain that libsplash does not depend on hdf5.
    This is a bug in Spack's dependency resolution. A workaround
    for this is to tell it to always depend on hdf5.
    ```
    
    @davydden
    ```
    to expand on @adamjstewart comment, spack will make a union
    of dependencies,
    i.e. hdf5@1.8.6: + hdf5+mpi = hdf5:1.8.6:+mpi, that's why it works.

    Adds a package for
    [PNGwriter](https://github.com/pngwriter/pngwriter/),
    a simple high-level C++ png API used in scientific projects.
    
    ```
    PNGwriter is a very easy to use open source graphics library that
    uses PNG as its output format. The interface has been designed to be
    as simple and intuitive as possible. It supports plotting and reading
    pixels in the RGB (red, green, blue), HSV (hue, saturation,
    value/brightness) and CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) colour
    spaces, basic shapes, scaling, bilinear interpolation, full TrueType
    antialiased and rotated text support, bezier curves, opening existing
    PNG images and more.
    ```
    
    PNGwriter is a dependency for [PIConGPU](http://picongpu.hzdr.de),
    an open-source, many-core, fully-relativistic particle-in-cell code
    and further software developed at
    [Helmholz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf](https://www.hzdr.de).

    Adds a package for
    [libSplash](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/libSplash),
    a high-level library around serial and parallel HDF5 for regular
    grids and particle data sets.
    
    ```
    libSplash aims at developing a HDF5-based I/O library for HPC
    simulations. It is created as an easy-to-use frontend for the
    standard HDF5 library with support for MPI processes in a cluster
    environment. While the standard HDF5 library provides detailed
    low-level control, libSplash simplifies tasks commonly found in
    large-scale HPC simulations, such as iter- ative computations
    and MPI distributed processes.

    an open-source, many-core, fully-relativistic particle-in-cell
    code and further software developed at
    [Helmholz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf](https://www.hzdr.de).
    
    libSplash builds in two versions, one without MPI writing
    domain-decomposed posix-style HDF5 files per process and one
    (default) with MPI and MPI-I/O (""parallel HDF5"") support
    aggregating into a single file per MPI communicator.
    
    libSplash is used in conjunction with
    [openPMD](http://openPMD.org), see also

    This also ensures that when a URL resource is fetched from a mirror,
    that it will be named as though it were retrieved from the original
    URL. This is particularly useful for non-expanded resources since it
    ensures that the resource name is consistent for the installation
    (this is less important for expanded resources because the build takes
    place inside the expanded resource).

9,21,Wednesday,2016,12,"    Stop python from linking with system ncurses (#1672)
    
    Python will look to link with libncursesw in preference to libncurses. Since
    ncurses in spack is built without suffixes there is no libncursesw and
    python will link to the system libncursesw for _curses.so and
    _curses_panel.so, as well as libpanelw for _curses_panel.so.
    
    This PR introduces a patch that simple removes the check for ncursesw in
    setup.py and therefore sets `curses_library` to `ncurses`.

10,6,Thursday,2016,2,"    Use a single lock file for stages and a single file for prefixes.
    
    - Locks now use fcntl range locks on a single file.
    
    How it works for prefixes:
    
    - Each lock is a byte range lock on the nth byte of a file.
    
    - The lock file is ``spack.installed_db.prefix_lock`` -- the DB tells us
      what to call it and it lives alongside the install DB.  n is the
      sys.maxsize-bit prefix of the DAG hash.
    
    For stages, we take the sha1 of the stage name and use that to select a
    byte to lock.
    
    With 100 concurrent builds, the likelihood of a false lock collision is
    ~5.36e-16, so this scheme should retain more than sufficient paralellism
    (with no chance of false negatives), and get us reader-writer lock
    semantics with a single file, so no need to clean up lots of lock files.

      - With ranges, we may never be able to take some legal write locks
        without invalidating all reads. e.g., if a write lock has distinct
        range from all reads, it should just work, but we'd have to close the
        file, reopen, and re-take reads.
    
    - It's easier to just check whether the file is writable in the first

10,10,Monday,2016,15,"    On Cray machines, use the Cray compile wrappers instead of MPI wrappers.
    
    + Cray compile wrappers are MPI wrappers.
    + Packages that need to be compiled with MPI compile wrappers normally use
      'mpicc', 'mpic++' and 'mpif90' provided by the MPI vendor. However, when using
      cray-mpich as the MPI vendor, the compile wrappers 'CC', 'cc' and 'ftn' must
      be used.
    + In this scenario, the mpich package is hijacked by specifying cray-mpich as an
      external package under the 'mpich:' section of packages.yaml. For example:
    
      packages:
        mpich:
          modules:
            mpich@7.4.2%intel@16.0.3 arch=cray-CNL-haswell: cray-mpich/7.4.2
          buildable: False
        all:
          providers:
            mpi: [mpich]
    
    + This change allows packages like parmetis to be built using the Cray compile
      wrappers. For example: 'spack install parmetis%intel@16.0.3 ^mpich@7.4.2 os=CNL'
    + This commit relies on the existence of the environment variable CRAYPE_VERSION
      to determine if the current machine is running a Cray environment. This check is
      insufficient, but I'm not sure how to improve this logic.

    * Change font deptype from build to default
    
    I wasn't sure which deptype was appropriate at first since none of
    the packages are actually linked together. I initially chose the
    build deptype for this reason. However, the font packages don't
    install into their own prefix. They install into font-config. If
    font-config is a build dependency, that means you can uninstall it
    without uninstalling the font packages, which wouldn't make sense
    since they install into font-config. So I switched them back to
    the default deptype.

    * mfem: add tarball extension
    
    Add tarball extension as a result of a feature added in PR#1926, which
    fixes earlier issues in this PR (PR#1202). Prior to adding this feature,
    Spack would not autodetect the extension of the tarball downloaded from
    the redirected, shorted Google URL, requiring a messy hack. This hack
    worked for mfem version 3.1, but led to errors when adding mfem version
    3.2 because the files downloaded from Google did not contain the package
    name, version number, or extension. Adding the extension enables Spack
    to rename the tarball downloaded from Google to a sensible name that is
    compatible with its filename parsing algorithms so that Spack ""does the
    right thing"" (detects that the file is a GZipped tarball, decompresses
    it, runs GNU Make) in fetching and staging the package.

    * build_environment: allow compilers to set up an environment
    
    * clang: mock up a toolchain directory for xcode
    
    Some projects ignore CC and CXX flags and instead use xcode to find the
    toolchain. Clang on Apple should set up the environment properly.
    Arguably, every compiler could do this on Apple, but let's see how this
    works out just for AppleClang for now.
    
    The Documentation directory is ~1.7G and the excluded platforms add up
    to about 7G. Ignoring swift saves another 500M. The resulting Xcode.app
    copy is in the 2G range.
    
    * compiler: set member variables early
    
    This is required so that later methods can query things such as the
    version of the compiler.
    
    * compiler: support finding the real path of the compiler
    
    On Apple, the /usr/bin compilers are actually wrapping tools themselves
    which query xcrun for the currently selected Xcode installation. Pierce
    this veil and get the real, full path the to underlying compilers
    instead.
    
    * icu4c: install with rpath
    
    On macOS, icu installs with a library ID of the library name. Enabling
    rpath makes its ID its full installed path which lets Qt5 link against
    it successfully.

    Use the python command sys.exec to get the correct directory, instead of the ad hoc self.prefix
    previously used
    
    This was a bear to debug; been driving me nuts since I started using spack.
    Since spack passes PYTHONHOME down to package builds in the environment
    it was passing PYTHONHOME of /usr/local/bin to the PETSc build that uses Python so
    the PETSc Python ./configure errored immediately with
    
    ImportError: No module named site
    
    since python could find no python modules. Todd Gamblin pointed out that my first try to fix
    this was wrong since it assumed the spack python was the same python used to run spack. Elizabeth Fischer
    suggested how to get it to work also with python3

10,31,Monday,2016,1,"    Removes cyclic dependency on spack.config. (#2121)
    
    Merge #2030 added a cyclic dependency between the Cray platform needing
    to read a `targets.yaml` config file and `config.py` needing to get the
    platform names.
    
    This commit removes the cyclic dependency in favor of the more general
    config scheme. It also removes the now functionless `targets.yaml`
    config file. This breaks 'frontend' targets on the Cray platform but
    all architecture targets, including the frontend, that are provided by
    CrayPE are added to the Platform anyway so users can be explicit about
    the architecture targeted by the Cray compiler wrappers:
    
    ```
    spack spec libelf arch=cray-CNL-frontend
    ```
    
    becomes
    
    ```
    spack spec libelf arch=cray-CNL-mc8         # on an XK7 or
    spack spec libelf arch=cray-CNL-sandybridge # on an older XC30, etc..
    ```
    
    The only way the 'frontend' target can be defined after this commit is
    through target environment variables.

    * Update go-bootstrap package
    
    The last C based Go src tree was the 1.4 series.  For a while they
    were cutting new releases so that people could bootstrap from a C only
    system.  Now they're recommending that you either use the release-1.4
    branch or that you use a date-stamped tarball that they'll produce on
    an as-needed basis.
    
    There are several issues that keep 1.4.2 from building on a CentOS 7
    system.
    
    I've switched to the date based tarball.
    
    The cgo bits were also mis-behaving, but they're not needed for the
    bootstrapping task so I've set an environment variable that disables
    them.

    * Add package for fastqc
    
    This tool is a java mess.  Their Way To Do It is to just copy the entire
    tree into it's final resting place, make the perl script at the top
    level executable and take it from there.
    
    Yuck.
    
    This package assumes that `set_executable` actually sets all the user
    bits.  If that change doesn't go in, then something equivalent needs to
    be done.
    
    * Use chmod to make fastqc executable
    
    I haven't gotten any feedback on changing set-executable, so switch to
    using chmod (from the cuda package).
    
    * Flake8 cleanup
    
    * Install files neatly, don't just copy top level of dir
    
    Rather than blindly copying everything in the distribution, carefully
    put the necessary bits into reasonable places.  Neatness counts, etc...
    
    This requires patching the `fastqc` perl script, so this commit adds a
    patch file.

    * Porting: substitute nose with ytest
    
    This huge commit substitutes nose with pytest as a testing system. Things done here:
    
    * deleted external/nose as it is no longer used
    * moved mock resources in their own directory 'test/mock/'
    * ported two tests (cmd/find, build_system) to pytest native syntax as an example
    * build_environment, log: used monkeypatch instead of try/catch
    * moved global mocking of fetch_cache to an auto-used fixture
    * moved global mocking from test/__init__.py to conftest.py
    * made `spack test` a wrapper around pytest
    * run-unit-tests: avoid running python 2.6 tests under coverage to speed them up
    * use `pytest --cov` instead of coverage run to cut down testing time
    
    * mock/packages_test: moved mock yaml configuration to files instead of leaving it in the code as string literals
    
    * concretize.py: ported tests to native pytest, reverted multiprocessing in pytest.ini as it was creating the wrong report for coveralls
    
    * conftest.py, fixtures: added docstrings

    * Add pytest and pytest-cov to Spack externals.
    
    * Make `spack flake8` ignore externals.
    
    * run-unit-tests runs spack test and not pytest.
    
    * Remove all the special stuff for `spack test`
    
    - Remove `conftest.py` magic and all the special case stuff in `bin/spack`
    
    - Spack commands can optionally take unknown arguments, if they want to
      handle them.
    
    - `spack test` is now a command like the others.
    
    - `spack test` now just delegates its arguments to `pytest`, but it does
      it by receiving unknown arguments and NOT taking an explicit
      help argument.
    
    * Fix error in fixtures.
    
    * Improve `spack test` command a bit.
    
    - Now supports an approximation of the old simple interface
    - Also supports full pytest options if you want them.
    
    * Use external coverage instead of pytest-cov
    
    * Make coverage use parallel-mode.

    Although it hurts a little, officially pre-compiled headers in

    Links to documentation and boost bug reports are inline, so
    people can later on check if they still apply. Seems just to
    be a bug in `Boost.Build` that tries to set `-o` with multiple

    When copying a spec, _concrete is always set to False for each
    dependency. ""Spec.satisfies"" was accessing the member ""_concrete""
    directly instead of using the property ""concrete"". This means that
    if you copy a spec, the dependencies will be considered equal, but
    did not necessarily satisfy one another. Spec.satisfies is a
    prerequisite for a package to be considered an extension; as a
    consequence, an extension with run-time dependencies that were also
    extensions did not activate those extensions. This updates
    Spec.satisfies to avoid checking the cached member ""_concrete""
    directly.
    
    * Added test to check for activation of dependency extension

    [The fix](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17986) for the small buglet addressed by `misc-cgo-testcshared.patch` has been merged into the tree a while back.  I was surprised to see that it wasn't in 1.7.5 and did a bit of digging.  It is *has not* been merged into the 1.7 branch but it *has* been merged into 1.8 (and therefor the patch will no longer be necessary).
    
    Figured I'd document my digging for the next person to come along.

    The python script ADIOS*/utils/gpp/gpp.py is invoked directly in the
    ADIOS*/tests/genarray/Makefile and the name of the python interpreter
    can be quite long if it is one built under spack, i.e. longer than the

    line is truncated at 80 characters and bash cannot find the python

    Fixes #1476
    
    Concretization uses compilers defined in config files and if those
    are not available defaults to searching typical paths where the
    detected operating system would have a compiler. If there is an OS
    update, the detected OS can change; in this case all compilers
    defined in the config files would no longer match (because they would
    be associated with the previous OS version). The error message in
    this case was too vague. This commit adds logic for detecting when it
    is likely that the OS has been updated (in particular when that
    affects compiler concretization) and improves the information provided
    to the user in the error message.

3,16,Thursday,2017,4,"    Dont auto-init compiler conf for 'compiler find' (#3439)
    
    Fixes #3428
    
    Users can run 'spack compiler find' to automatically initialize their
    compilers.yaml configuration file. It also turns out that Spack will
    implicitly initialize the compilers configuration file as part of
    detecting compilers if none are found (so if a user were to attempt to
    concretize a spec without running 'spack compiler find' it would not
    fail). However, in this case Spack was overlooking its own implicit
    initialization of the config files and would report that no new
    compilers were found. This commit removes implicit initialization when
    the user calls 'spack compiler find'.
    
    This did not surface until #2999 because the 'spack compiler' command
    defaulted to using a scope 'user/platform' that was not accounted for
    in get_compiler_config (where the implicit initialization logic
    predates the addition of this new scope); #2999 removed the scope
    specification when checking through config files, leading to the
    implicit initialization.

3,25,Saturday,2017,4,"    Fix concretization bugs with virtuals and deptypes.
    
    1. Fix #2807: Can't depend on virtual and non-virtual package
    
    - This is tested by test_my_dep_depends_on_provider_of_my_virtual_dep in
      the concretize.py test.
    
    - This was actually working in the test suite, but it depended on the
      order the dependencies were resolved in. Resolving non-virtual then
      virtual worked, but virtual, then non-virtual did not.
    
    - Problem was that an unnecessary copy was made of a spec that already
      had some dependencies set up, and the copy lost half of some of the
      dependency relationships.  This caused the ""can'd depend on X twice
      error"".
    
    - Fix by eliminating unnecessary copy and ensuring that dep parameter of
      _merge_dependency is always safe to own -- i.e. it's a defensive copy
      from somewhere else.
    
    2. Fix bug and simplify concretization of deptypes.
    
    - deptypes weren't being accumulated; they were being set on each
      DependencySpec. This could cause concretization to get into an infinite
      loop.
    
    - Fixed by accumulating deptypes in DependencySpec.update_deptypes()
    
    - Also simplified deptype normalization logic: deptypes are now merged in
      constrain() like everything else -- there is no need to merge them
      specially or to look at dpeendents in _merge_dependency().
    
    - Add some docstrings to deptype tests.

    * Fix nettle dependency
    
    GnuTLS requires a nettle from the 2.7 series, won't work
    with 3.x (so sayeth configure when it crashes...).
    
    * Fix configure symlinking GNUmakefile to itself
    
    I'm confused about how this ever worked, but....
    
    As configure runs, it does something like this:
    
    ```
    config.status: linking /home/hartzelg/tmp/spack/var/spack/stage/gnutls-3.3.9-uq2u4ecucncv2l3akran765aystyvkys/gnutls-3.3.9/GNUmakefile to GNUmakefile
    ```
    
    and since that is the cwd the build crashes with:
    
    ```
    ==> 'make' '-j28'
    make: GNUmakefile: Too many levels of symbolic links
    make: stat: GNUmakefile: Too many levels of symbolic links
    make: *** No rule to make target `GNUmakefile'.  Stop.
    ```
    
    Since the comment in the configure script points out that the
    GNUmakefile is ""only for the maintainer"" I've just commented out the
    bit that leads to the symlinking.
    
    Builds for me on CentOS 7.  (I do have a recent-ish set of auto-*
    things in my patch via linuxbrew)

    We really want < 3.0 but there's not a good way to express it.

    - package as openfoam-com to reflect the distribution point.
    
    This initial spack packaging for OpenFOAM supports a number of possible
    variants and should handle 64-bit labels properly now that the scotch
    package has been updated accordingly.
    
    * ENH: update package for foam-extend (extend-project.de)
    
    - provide 'openfoam' as virtual package.
    
    - much of the build is now aligned with how the openfoam-com package
      looks, with the aim of future refactoring.
    
    - avoid installing intermediate targets.
    
    - contains its own environment sourcing script for the build, for more
      flexibility and robustness (doesn't touch the python build environ)
    
    * ENH: added package for building from openfoam.org
    
    - provide 'openfoam' as a virtual package.
    
    - this is largely a direct copy of the openfoam-com package.
      It has been supplied as a courtesy for users and to ensure maximum
      consistency in quality and naming between the foam-extend,
      openfoam-com and openfoam-org packages.

    Adds the [ISAAC](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/isaac)
    in situ volume rendering library. The ISAAC library can be build with
    render/filter kernels for Nvidia GPUs via CUDA or with a more general
    backend via [Alpaka](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/alpaka)
    with support for Nvidia GPUs (via CUDA) and multicore CPUs.
    
    Since alpaka is not yet part of spack, the second variant is still
    commented out.
    
    Packages
    
    - `isaac`: header-only library with dependencies to other C++ libraries
               that is then used in simulations
    - `isaac-server`: stand-alone executable that connects N simulations with M
                      clients in a `N simulations:1 server` and
                      `1 server:M clients` fashion
    
    (ISAAC clients simply speak websockets/JSON and are usually
    [HTML/JS pages](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/isaac/tree/v1.2.0/client))
    
    Downstream Usage
    
    PIConGPU uses ISAAC for in situ visualization.

4,19,Wednesday,2017,3,"    Override partial installs by default (#3530)
    
    * Package install remove prior unfinished installs
    
    Depending on how spack is terminated in the middle of building a
    package it may leave a partially installed package in the install
    prefix. Originally Spack treated the package as being installed if
    the prefix was present, in which case the user would have to
    manually remove the installation prefix before restarting an
    install. This commit adds a more thorough check to ensure that a
    package is actually installed. If the installation prefix is present
    but Spack determines that the install did not complete, it removes
    the installation prefix and starts a new install; if the user has
    enabled --keep-prefix, then Spack reverts to its old behavior.
    
    * Added test for partial install handling
    
    * Added test for restoring DB
    
    * Style fixes
    
    * Restoring 2.6 compatibility
    
    * Relocated repair logic to separate function
    
    * If --keep-prefix is set, package installs will continue an install from an existing prefix if one is present
    
    * check metadata consistency when continuing partial install
    
    * Added --force option to make spack reinstall a package (and all dependencies) from scratch

4,21,Friday,2017,1,"    Fix ABI detection issues with macOS gcc. (#3854)
    
    - gcc on macOS says it's version 4.2.1, but it's really clang, and it's
      actually the *same* clang as the system clang.
    
    - It also doesn't respond with a full path when called with
      --print-file-name=libstdc++.dylib, which is expected from gcc in abi.py.
      Instead, it gives a relative path and _gcc_compiler_compare doesn't
      understand what to do with it.  This results in errors like:
    
      ```
      lib/spack/spack/abi.py, line 71, in _gcc_get_libstdcxx_version
          libpath = os.readlink(output.strip())
      OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'libstdc++.dylib'
      ```
    
    - This commit does two things:
    
      1. Ignore any gcc that's actually clang in abi.py.  We can probably do
         better than this, but it's not clear there is a need to, since we
         should handle the compiler as clang, not gcc.
    
      2. Don't auto-detect any ""gcc"" that is actually clang anymore.  Ignore
         it and expect people to use clang (which is the default macOS
         compiler anyway).
    
    Users can still add fake gccs to their compilers.yaml if they want, but
    it's discouraged.

    Perl was not previously an explicit dependency but the configure
    script was likely to discover one on your system (`/usr/bin/perl`).
    It is now a variant that defaults to `True`.
    
    I am unable to accurately determine what these flags to the configure
    script enable.  My users are frustrated by the dependency on Python in
    particular because it constrains the other modules that they can have

    * Fixed alquimia package
    
    Alquimia expects PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH to be defined, and
    refuses to install if they are not.  Spack does not define PETSC_
    ARCH, so Alquimia will not install.  This patch does two things
    to fix the alquimia build:
    
    1. A patch has been added to remove the dependency on PETSC_ARCH.
    
    2. Alquimia currently depends on old versions of PETSc and pflotran.
       @ghammond86 updated the alquimia interfaces to use more recent
       versions, but his patch is still sitting in an alquimia pull
       request.  As a result, the spack installer now uses his fork
       of alquimia.  This is a temporary fix until his pull request is
       accepted.
    
    * Need to pass to Alquimia the MPI compilers, not the raw compilers

    The patch was out of date and has been updated accordingly.
    
    * Added Tpetra-free option to Trilinos
    
    The Tpetra stack takes forever to build and is not used by any of the
    IDEAS teams, so there should be an option to disable it.  I have added
    this option and updated the xSDK accordingly.  I also disabled
    xSDKTrilinos in the xSDK, since none of the apps teams currently use it,
    and it's largely Tpetra-based.
    
    * Removed alquimia patch from develop version
    
    The patch has been incorporated into alquimia and is no longer
    necessary for the develop version.  The tagged version has not
    been updated accordingly and still needs the patch for now.
    (When the tagged version gets updated, the patch does need to be
    removed from spack altogether, or it will break the build.)
    
    * Removed patch from alquimia
    
    It has been incorporated into alquimia, both the develop and
    rc2 tagged versions.  The 0.2.0 version of alquimia has been updated

    * Hackery to get gtkplus to build
    
    PR #3077 broke gtkplus by introducing gobject-introspection.
    
    This big hack makes things work.  It has problems.
    
    1. Rather than deal with the nasty sbang fooey in the
       g-ir-tool-template.in derived scripts, it just adds a python
       dependency to each package that runs one of the scripts.  This lets
       the `/usr/bin/env python` sbang do the right thing.
    
    2. It stuffs a several directories on to the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment
       variable, which is used for (among other things) locating the .gir
       files.
    
    3. It avoids building the gtkplus demos because I can't make the bit
       that calls `gdk-pixbuf-csource` work.  It doesn't think that it can
       load `.png` files and all of the google hits I found suggest a bad
       `loader.cache` file.  The file's fine and I can strace the command
       and watch it read it in...  Many, many hours wasted here.
    
       In spite of the demo failing, the tests pass and an emacs built
       with this lib seems to work.
    
    * Fix sbang so everyone needn't depend_on python
    
    Rather than have every package that
    `depends_on('gobject-introspection')` also need to
    `depend_on('python')`, this commit fixes the
    scripts (e.g. `g-ir-scanner`).
    
    The interesting bit is in the gobject-introspection package.  There is
    a beefy comment there that is included below.
    
    The commit also removes the now un-necessary dependencies from various
    packages.
    
    I have two reservations about this commit:
    
    1. How portable is the ""insertion"" sed command?  I'm particularly
       worried that some sed's might need the line to insert to be on a
       different line, which I can't imagine how to cram into the
       Makefile.in.
    
       The solution I see to this is rather than extending the existing
       sed command in the Makefile I could shim in another line in the
       rule and e.g. call a bit of Perl (or Python, I suppose) which would
       end up being much neater.
    
    2. As written it always uses Spack's `.../bin/sbang`, which might or
       might not be a good idea.
    
       If I use ""the solution"" from number 1 above, then I can check the
       line length before I munge it.  Otherwise???

     this problem can't help us.                                                                                                              |

4,29,Saturday,2017,2,"    Python command, libraries, and headers (#3367)
    
    ## Motivation
    
    Python installations are both important and unfortunately inconsistent. Depending on the Python version, OS, and the strength of the Earth's magnetic field when it was installed, the name of the Python executable, directory containing its libraries, library names, and the directory containing its headers can vary drastically.
    
    I originally got into this mess with #3274, where I discovered that Boost could not be built with Python 3 because the executable is called `python3` and we were telling it to use `python`. I got deeper into this mess when I started hacking on #3140, where I discovered just how difficult it is to find the location and name of the Python libraries and headers.
    
    Currently, half of the packages that depend on Python and need to know this information jump through hoops to determine the correct information. The other half are hard-coded to use `python`, `spec['python'].prefix.lib`, and `spec['python'].prefix.include`. Obviously, none of these packages would work for Python 3, and there's no reason to duplicate the effort. The Python package itself should contain all of the information necessary to use it properly. This is in line with the recent work by @alalazo and @davydden with respect to `spec['blas'].libs` and friends.
    
    ## Prefix
    
    For most packages in Spack, we assume that the installation directory is `spec['python'].prefix`. This generally works for anything installed with Spack, but gets complicated when we include external packages. Python is a commonly used external package (it needs to be installed just to run Spack). If it was installed with Homebrew, `which python` would return `/usr/local/bin/python`, and most users would erroneously assume that `/usr/local` is the installation directory. If you peruse through #2173, you'll immediately see why this is not the case. Homebrew actually installs Python in `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.12_2` and symlinks the executable to `/usr/local/bin/python`. `PYTHONHOME` (and presumably most things that need to know where Python is installed) needs to be set to the actual installation directory, not `/usr/local`.
    
    Normally I would say, ""sounds like user error, make sure to use the real installation directory in your `packages.yaml`"". But I think we can make a special case for Python. That's what we decided in #2173 anyway. If we change our minds, I would be more than happy to simplify things.
    
    To solve this problem, I created a `spec['python'].home` attribute that works the same way as `spec['python'].prefix` but queries Python to figure out where it was actually installed. @tgamblin Is there any way to overwrite `spec['python'].prefix`? I think it's currently immutable.
    
    ## Command
    
    In general, Python 2 comes with both `python` and `python2` commands, while Python 3 only comes with a `python3` command. But this is up to the OS developers. For example, `/usr/bin/python` on Gentoo is actually Python 3. Worse yet, if someone is using an externally installed Python, all 3 commands may exist in the same directory! Here's what I'm thinking:
    
    If the spec is for Python 3, try searching for the `python3` command.
    If the spec is for Python 2, try searching for the `python2` command.
    If neither are found, try searching for the `python` command.
    
    ## Libraries
    
    Spack installs Python libraries in `spec['python'].prefix.lib`. Except on openSUSE 13, where it installs to `spec['python'].prefix.lib64` (see #2295 and #2253). On my CentOS 6 machine, the Python libraries are installed in `/usr/lib64`. Both need to work.
    
    The libraries themselves change name depending on OS and Python version. For Python 2.7 on macOS, I'm seeing:
    ```
    lib/libpython2.7.dylib
    ```
    For Python 3.6 on CentOS 6, I'm seeing:
    ```
    lib/libpython3.so
    lib/libpython3.6m.so.1.0
    lib/libpython3.6m.so -> lib/libpython3.6m.so.1.0
    ```
    Notice the `m` after the version number. Yeah, that's a thing.
    
    ## Headers
    
    In Python 2.7, I'm seeing:
    ```
    include/python2.7/pyconfig.h
    ```
    In Python 3.6, I'm seeing:
    ```
    include/python3.6m/pyconfig.h
    ```
    It looks like all Python 3 installations have this `m`. Tested with Python 3.2 and 3.6 on macOS and CentOS 6
    
    Spack has really nice support for libraries (`find_libraries` and `LibraryList`), but nothing for headers. Fixed.

5,4,Thursday,2017,11,"    SV variants are evaluated correctly in ""when=""  (#4118)
    
    * SV variants are evaluated correctly in `when=` statements fixes #4113
    
    The problem here was tricky:
    ```python
    spec.satisfies(other)
    ```
    changes already the MV variants in others into SV variants (where
    necessary) if spec is concrete. If it is not concrete it does
    nothing because we may be acting at a pure syntactical level.
    
    When evaluating a `when=` keyword spec is for sure not concrete
    as it is in the middle of the concretization process. In this case we
    have to trigger manually the substitution in other to not end up
    comparing a MV variant ""foo=bar"" to a SV variant ""foo=bar"" and having
    False in return. Which is wrong.

    * Trailing whitespace cleanup
    
    * Handcraft an install process for mummer (grumble)
    
    Mummer punts on an installation step, they just build in and run from
    the same directory.
    
    Mummer also has various hardcoded paths built into it that allow it to
    find other executables that it needs as well as its Perl library.
    
    This updates the package to deal with this approach.
    
    It patches the Makefile and scripts/Makefile so that the correct info
    is fed to sed when it munges the perl scripts.
    
    The install step is now finer grained and puts things where mummer
    relatively wants to find them.

    * Tighten up graphviz package
    
    The fun started when configure discovered a broken/partial
    installation of `swig` in `/usr/local`, then auto-discovered my
    system's python and ruby packages.
    
    - SpackException doesn't seem to exist.  Convert it to a SpackError
      and call `.format(...)` on the error string to fill in the
      placeholder.
    
    - Pull swig out of the list of languages.  It's something that can be
      asked for explicitly and that is needed if *any* of the langagues
      are enabled.  It's disabled by default.
    
    - Explicitly disable the languages that are in ""untested_bindings""
      list lest the configure script pick up things from the system.
    
    * Touch up variant description string
    
    * Clean up conditional statement
    
    * Use InstallError, not SpackError
    
    * Drop the swig variant
    
    Get rid of the swig variant and drive that bit based on whether any
    languages are enabled.
    
    * Move perl to the untested list
    
    That's not strictly accurate.  I tested it and it doesn't work.
    
    There's a missing depends_on().  When you add that you'll discover
    that the language binding bit can't find Perl's 'EXTERN.h'.  Then
    you'll discover that graphviz's `configure` script doesn't have a good
    way to include the paths to Perl's bits (looks like I'll have to
    gather them for each language and then use them to build `CFLAGS` and
    `CXXFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`).  While pondering that, you'll discover that
    EXTERN.h is buried down here:
    
    ```
    opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/perl-5.24.1-35ejv4426dmzreum4ekdibu3ddmhquvi/lib/5.24.1/x86_64-linux/CORE/EXTERN.h
    ```
    
    and decide that you wish you had never thought to actually test
    `graphviz+perl`.
    
    I could find that directory with a snippet like so:
    
    ```
    perl -MConfig -e 'print ""$Config{archlib}\n""'
    ```
    
    but at this point I'm much, much further down this rabbit hole then I
    ever wanted to go.
    
    * Convince python that tested_bindings is a list
    
    When I removed `+perl` and made `tested_bindings` a list of one
    thing, I ended up with this:
    
    ```
    ==> Error: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'tuple' objects

    systems have SYS_memfd_create defined to __NR_memfd_create but are
    missing the second definition.  This is a belt and suspenders solution
    to the problem.
    
    See [this post][syscall] for a nice general description of how these
    parts fit together.

    * mv variants: packages are now needed only during normalization
    
    The relationship among different types of variants have been weakened,
    in the sense that now it is permitted to compare MV, SV and BV among
    each other. The mechanism that permits this is an implicit conversion
    of the variant passed as argument to the type of the variant asking
    to execute a constrain, satisfies, etc. operation.
    
    * asbtract variant: added a new type of variant
    
    An abstract variant is like a multi valued variant, but behaves
    differently on ""satisfies"" requests, because it will reply ""True""
    to requests that **it could** satisfy eventually.
    
    Tests have been modified to reflect the fact that abstract variants
    are now what get parsed from expressions like `foo=bar` given by users.
    
    * Removed 'concrete=' and 'normal=' kwargs from Spec.__init__
    
    These two keyword arguments where only used in one test module to force
    a Spec to 'appear' concrete. I suspect they are just a leftover from
    another refactoring, as now there's the private method '_mark_concrete'
    that does essentially the same job. Removed them to reduce a bit the
    clutter in Spec.
    
    * Moved yaml related functions from MultiValuedVariant to AbstractVariant.
    
    This is to fix the erros that are occurring in epfl-scitas#73, and that
    I can't reproduce locally.

    * few kinks for moab
    
    zoltan should be built without fortran api, otherwise moab
    complains (need to fix)
    also, notice that when built with cgm, shared can't find
    cgm libraries for the new tools/geometry execs
    
    install in serial for the time being (because of example makefile
    duplicate?)
    
    for example, these builds are successful:

    spack install moab+mpi+hdf5+shared ^mpich@3.2
    
    * force hdf5+mpi if both are specified

    * for meshkit, moab needs to have irel, fbigeom
    
    * forgot to self.spec
    
    after building moab with cgm with oce 0.17.2, we can build
    meshkit with something like this
    spack install meshkit ^moab/tsb75zk

    * Fix flake8 error-whitespack issue in mrnet package.py file.
    
    * Add updates based on spack reviewer feedback.
    
    * More fixes based on comments from reviewers.  Switch using extend to using append, remove additional setting of PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH that should not be required due to RPATH.
    
    * More review related changes.  Update MPIOption.append lines and take out xercesc references.
    
    * Create a base options function for common openspeedshop base cmake options to reduce redundencies.
    
    * Add libxml2+python depends on to get around issues with the libxml2 package file.
    
    * Using boost over 1.60.0 causes compile errors.  This is a known boost bug. Also, dyninst-9.2.0 is set to be the vesrion of dyninst to use with OSS, as of now. The newer version fails to build.

    * A fix was added for setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the qt3 build, but if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set the qt build fails. So so check and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH if not set, update if it is set.
    
    * Update the fix for qt3 build by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of checking for whether it is set or not per Adams comment that spack clears LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    implementation still makes use of `find`, the rationale being that we
    have already seen packages that install artifacts in e.g. architecture
    dependent folders. The possibility to have a relative search path might
    be a good compromise between the previous approach and the one suggested
    in the review.

    The recent expat release requires a high quality source of randomness.

    need to specify `~libbsd`.

    * Fix crashes when running spack install under nohup
    
    Fixes #4919
    
    For reasons that I do not entire understand, duplicate_stream() throws
    an '[Errno 22] Invalid argument' exception when it tries to
    `os.fdopen()` the duplicated file descriptor generated by
    `os.dup(original.fileno())`.  See spack/llnl/util/lang.py, line
    394-ish.
    
    This happens when run under `nohup`, which supposedly has hooked
    `stdin` to `/dev/null`.
    
    It seems like opening and using `devnull` on the `input_stream` in
    this situation is a reasonable way to handle the problem.
    
    * Be more specific about error being handled.
    
    Only catch the specific error that happens when trying to dup
    the stdin that nohup provides.
    
    Catching e as a StandardErorr and then
    `type(e).__name__` tells me that it's an OSError.

    * Fix cdefs macro to be compatible with gcc 4.8.x
    
    See the discussion in #4945 (after the merge) for additional
    background.
    
    libbsd builds with gcc@5.4.0 on CentOS 7, but not with the system's
    gcc@4.8.5.  Others have reported problems with gcc@4.8.3 on Fedora 19.
    
    The problem boils down to the lack of support for the clang extension
    `__has_include_next`.  The immediate symptom seems to be the
    pre-processor using defining macro like this
    
    ```
    ```
    
    then then tripping over an expansion of it like this:
    
    ```
    blah.h:13:23: error: missing binary operator before token ""(""
    ```
    
    This patch changes the macro definition to:
    
    ```
    ```
    
    which swallows the arguments with which the macro is invoked.
    
    The end result is that libbsd builds for me on CentOS 7 using the
    system compiler.

    Earlier versions of boost had a fixed maximum number of jobs.  1.54
    was 64, it bumped once or twice afterwards and in 1.59 [this
    commit][commit] it became dynamic.

8,14,Monday,2017,1,"    Fix exit call in `SpackError.die()`
    
    - Previously we would use `os._exit()` in to avoid Spack error handling
      in the parent process when build processes failed.  This isn't
      necessary anymore since build processes propagate their exceptions to
      the parent process.
    
    - Use `sys.exit` instead of `os._exit`. This has the advantage of

8,14,Monday,2017,2,"    Rework output redirection in Spack.
    
    - Simplify interface to log_output. New interface requires only one
      context handler instead of two.  Before:
    
          with log_output('logfile.txt') as log_redirection:
               with log_redirection:
                   # do things ... output will be logged
    
      After:
    
          with log_output('logfile.txt'):
              # do things ... output will be logged
    
      If you also want the output to be echoed to ``stdout``, use the
      `echo` parameter::
    
          with log_output('logfile.txt', echo=True):
              # do things ... output will be logged and printed out
    
      And, if you just want to echo *some* stuff from the parent, use
      ``force_echo``:
    
          with log_output('logfile.txt', echo=False) as logger:
              # do things ... output will be logged
    
              with logger.force_echo():
                  # things here will be echoed *and* logged
    
      A key difference between this and the previous implementation is that
      *everything* in the context handler is logged.  Previously, things like
      `Executing phase 'configure'` would not be logged, only output to the
      screen, so understanding phases in the build log was difficult.
    
    - The implementation of `log_output()` is different in two major ways:
    
      1. This implementation avoids race cases by using only one pipe (before
         we had a multiprocessing pipe and a unix pipe).  The logger daemon
         stops naturally when the input stream is closed, which avoids a race
         in the previous implementation where we'd miss some lines of output
         because the parent would shut the daemon down before it was done
         with all output.
    
      2. Instead of turning output redirection on and off, which prevented
         some things from being logged, this version uses control characters
         in the output stream to enable/disable forced echoing.  We're using
         the time-honored xon and xoff codes, which tell the daemon to echo
         anything between them AND write it to the log.  This is how
         `logger.force_echo()` works.
    
    - Fix places where output could get stuck in buffers by flushing more
      aggressively.  This makes the output printed to the terminal the same
      as that which would be printed through a pipe to `cat` or to a file.
      Previously these could be weirdly different, and some output would be
      missing when redirecting Spack to a file or pipe.
    
    - Simplify input and color handling in both `build_environment.fork()`
      and `llnl.util.tty.log.log_output()`.  Neither requires an input_stream
      parameter anymore; we assume stdin will be forwarded if possible.
    
    - remove `llnl.util.lang.duplicate_stream()` and remove associated
      monkey-patching in tests, as these aren't needed if you just check
      whether stdin is a tty and has a fileno attribute.

    Adds the ""buildcache"" command to spack. The buildcache command is
    used to create gpg signatures for archives of installed spack
    packages; the signatures and archives are placed together in a
    directory that can be added to a spack mirror. A user can retrieve
    the archives from a mirror and verify their integrity using the
    buildcache command. It is often the case that the user's Spack
    instance is located in a different path compared to the Spack
    instance used to generate the package archive and signature, so
    this includes logic to relocate the RPATHs generated by Spack.

    In this way not defining 'dirty' will result in an error, instead of the default value being used. This will reduce the risk of having an inconsistent behavior after a refactoring.

        - Extracted the creation of a ProviderIndex to its own factory function.

          This class can serialize and deserialize objects from json. Repo and
          RepoPath have a new method 'packages_with_tags', that uses the TagIndex
          to compute a list of package names that have all the tags passed as
          arguments.

    - Fixes bugs where concretization would fail due to an erroneously cached
      _concrete attribute.
    
    - Ripped out a bunch of code in spec.py that isn't needed/valid anymore:
      - The various concrete() methods on different types of Specs would
        attempt to statically compute whether the Spec was concrete.
      - This dates back to when DAGs were simpler and there were no optional
        dependencies.  It's actually NOT possible to compute statically
        whether a Spec is concrete now.  The ONLY way you know is if it goes
        through concretization and is marked concrete once that completes.
      - This commit removes all simple concreteness checks and relies only on
        the _concrete attribute.  This should make thinking about
        concreteness simpler.
    
    - Fixed a couple places where Specs need to be marked concrete explicitly.
      - Specs read from files and Specs that are destructively copied from
        concrete Specs now need to be marked concrete explicitly.
      - These spots may previously have ""worked"", but they were brittle and
        should be explcitly marked anyway.

9,19,Tuesday,2017,7,"    Modulefiles generated with a template engine (#3183)
    
    * Module files now are generated using a template engine refers #2902 #3173
    
    jinja2 has been hooked into Spack.
    
    The python module `modules.py` has been splitted into several modules
    under the python package `spack/modules`. Unit tests stressing module
    file generation have been refactored accordingly.
    
    The module file generator for Lmod has been extended to multi-providers
    and deeper hierarchies.
    
    * Improved the support for templates in module files.
    
    Added an entry in `config.yaml` (`template_dirs`) to list all the
    directories where Spack could find templates for `jinja2`.
    
    Module file generators have a simple override mechanism to override
    template selection ('modules.yaml' beats 'package.py' beats 'default').
    
    * Added jinja2 and MarkupSafe to vendored packages.
    
    * Spec.concretize() sets mutual spec-package references
    
    The correct place to set the mutual references between spec and package
    objects at the end of concretization. After a call to concretize we
    should now be ensured that spec is the same object as spec.package.spec.
    
    Code in `build_environment.py` that was performing the same operation
    has been turned into an assertion to be defensive on the new behavior.
    
    * Improved code and data layout for modules and related tests.
    
    Common fixtures related to module file generation have been extracted
    in `conftest.py`. All the mock configurations for module files have been
    extracted from python code and have been put into their own yaml file.
    
    Added a `context_property` decorator for the template engine, to make
    it easy to define dictionaries out of properties.
    
    The default for `verbose` in `modules.yaml` is now False instead of True.
    
    * Extendable module file contexts + short description from docstring
    
    The contexts that are used in conjunction with `jinja2` templates to
    generate module files can now be extended from package.py and
    modules.yaml.
    
    Module files generators now infer the short description from package.py
    docstring (and as you may expect it's the first paragraph)
    
    * 'module refresh' regenerates all modules by default
    
    `module refresh` without `--module-type` specified tries to
    regenerate all known module types. The same holds true for `module rm`
    
    Configure options used at build time are extracted and written into the
    module files where possible.
    
    * Fixed python3 compatibility, tests for Lmod and Tcl.
    
    Added test for exceptional paths of execution when generating Lmod
    module files.
    
    Fixed a few compatibility issues with python3.
    
    Fixed a bug in Tcl with naming_scheme and autoload + unit tests
    
    * Updated module file tutorial docs. Fixed a few typos in docstrings.
    
    The reference section for module files has been reorganized. The idea is
    to have only three topics at the highest level:
    
      - shell support + spack load/unload use/unuse
      - module file generation (a.k.a. APIs + modules.yaml)
      - module file maintenance (spack module refresh/rm)
    
    Module file generation will cover the entries in modules.yaml
    
    Also:
    
      - Licenses have been updated to include NOTICE and extended to 2017
      - docstrings have been reformatted according to Google style
    
    * Removed redundant arguments to RPackage and WafPackage.
    
    All the callbacks in `RPackage` and `WafPackage` that are not build
    phases have been modified not to accept a `spec` and a `prefix`
    argument. This permits to leverage the common `configure_args` signature
    to insert by default the configuration arguments into the generated
    module files. I think it's preferable to handling those packages
    differently than `AutotoolsPackage`. Besides only one package seems
    to override one of these methods.
    
    * Fixed broken indentation + improved resiliency of refresh
    
    Fixed broken indentation in `spack module refresh` (probably a rebase
    gone silently wrong?). Filter the writers for blacklisted specs before
    searching for name clashes. An error with a single writer will not
    stop regeneration, but instead will print a warning and continue
    the command.

    reliant on PMIx including MPICH, GASNet, the OpenSHMEM reference

9,23,Saturday,2017,1,"    Patches are hashed with specs, and can be associated with dependencies.
    
    - A package can depend on a special patched version of its dependencies.
    
      - The `Spec` YAML (and therefore the hash) now includes the sha256 of
        the patch in the `Spec` YAML, which changes its hash.
    
      - The special patched version will be built separately from a ""vanilla""
        version of the same package.
    
      - This allows packages to maintain patches on their dependencies
        without affecting either the dependency package or its dependents.
        This could previously be accomplished with special variants, but
        having to add variants means the hash of the dependency changes
        frequently when it really doesn't need to.  This commit allows the
        hash to change *just* for dependencies that need patches.
    
      - Patching dependencies shouldn't be the common case, but some packages
        (qmcpack, hpctoolkit, openspeedshop) do this kind of thing and it
        makes the code structure mirror maintenance responsibilities.
    
    - Note that this commit means that adding or changing a patch on a
      package will change its hash.  This is probably what *should* happen,
      but we haven't done it so far.
    
      - Only applies to `patch()` directives; `package.py` files (and their
        `patch()` functions) are not hashed, but we'd like to do that in the
        future.
    
    - The interface looks like this: `depends_on()` can optionally take a
      patch directive or a list of them:
    
         depends_on(<spec>,
                    patches=patch(..., when=<cond>),
                    when=<cond>)
         # or
         depends_on(<spec>,
                    patches=[patch(..., when=<cond>),
                             patch(..., when=<cond>)],
                    when=<cond>)
    
    - Previously, the `patch()` directive only took an `md5` parameter.  Now
      it only takes a `sha256` parameter.  We restrict this because we want
      to be consistent about which hash is used in the `Spec`.
    
    - A side effect of hashing patches is that *compressed* patches fetched
      from URLs now need *two* checksums: one for the downloaded archive and
      one for the content of the patch itself.  Patches fetched uncompressed
      only need a checksum for the patch.  Rationale:
    
      - we include the content of the *patch* in the spec hash, as that is
        the checksum we can do consistently for patches included in Spack's
        source and patches fetched remotely, both compressed and
        uncompressed.
    
      - we *still* need the patch of the downloaded archive, because we want
        to verify the download *before* handing it off to tar, unzip, or
        another decompressor.  Not doing so is a security risk and leaves
        users exposed to any arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities in
        compression tools.

    Currently, if a user sets an external package to have a prefix that is
    one of the system paths (like '/usr') the module files that are
    generated will prepend '/usr/bin' to 'PATH', etc. This is particularly
    nasty at the time when a module file is unloaded, and e.g. paths like
    '/usr/bin' will be discarded from PATH.
    
    This PR solves the issue skipping system paths when a prefix inspection
    is made to generate module files.

    * Add updates based on spack reviewer feedback.

    * More review related changes.  Update MPIOption.append lines and take out xercesc references.
    
    * Create a base options function for common openspeedshop base cmake options to reduce redundencies.
    
    * Add libxml2+python depends on to get around issues with the libxml2 package file.

    * A fix was added for setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the qt3 build, but if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not set the qt build fails. So so check and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH if not set, update if it is set.
    
    * Update the fix for qt3 build by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of checking for whether it is set or not per Adams comment that spack clears LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    * Fix tabs versus spaces and swap if and else clause check from a negative to a positive check.
    
    * Add ability to build llvm-openmp-ompt alone, with gnu compilers and use the resulting ompt interface in cbtf-krell and openspeedshop to gather openmp specific performance information.

    Currently, ncl is configured using a transient temp directory. This
    leads to warnings such as this when executing ncl later on:
    
    warning:""/tmp/ncl_ncar_xxxxxx"" tmp dir does not exist or is not writable:
    NCL functionality may be limited -- check TMPDIR environment variable
    
    As this also breaks some functionality, use the system temp directory
    instead (typically /tmp).
    
    * ncl: Depend on esmf
    
    esmf is required for some ncl scripts (such as ESMF_regridding.ncl).

10,12,Thursday,2017,4,"    Speed up concretization (#5716)
    
    This isn't a rework of the concretizer but it speeds things up a LOT.
    
    The main culprits were:
      1. Variant code, `provider_index`, and `concretize.py` were calling
         `spec.package` when they could use `spec.package_class`
        - `spec.package` looks up a package instance by `Spec`, which requires a
          (fast-ish but not that fast) DAG compare.
        - `spec.package_class` just looks up the package's class by name, and you
            should use this when all you need is metadata (most of the time).
        - not really clear that the current way packages are looked up is
          necessary -- we can consider refactoring that in the future.
    
      2. `Repository.repo_for_pkg` parses a `str` argument into a `Spec` when
         called with one, via `@_autospec`, but this is not needed.
         - Add some faster code to handle strings directly and avoid parsing
    
    This speeds up concretization 3-9x in my limited tests.  Still not super
    fast but much more bearable:

10,12,Thursday,2017,2,"    Better install output (#5714)
    
    * Do not call setup_package for fake installs
    
    - setup package could fail if ``setup_dependent_environment`` or other
      routines expected to use executables from dependencies
    
    - xpetsc and boost try to get python config variables in
      `setup_dependent_package`; this would cause them not to be
      fake-installable
    
    * Remove vestigial deptype_query argument to Spec.traverse()
    
    - The `deptype_query` argument isn't used anymore -- it's only passed
      around and causes confusion when calling traverse.
    
    - Get rid of it and just keep the `deptypes` argument
    
    * Don't print redundant messages when installing dependencies
    
    - `do_install()` was originally depth-first recursive, and printed ""<pkg>
      already installed in ..."" multiple times for packages as recursive
      calls encountered them.
    
    - For much cleaner output, use spec.traverse(order='post') to install
      dependencies instead

    Perl installs a couple of config files that need to be munged so that
    they don't refer to the spack compiler.  These files are installed
    read-only.  Behind the scenes 'filter_file' moves its file to a safe
    place, and tries to create a working file that is both O_WRONLY and
    has the perms of the original file.  On an NFSv4 filesystem, the
    combination of 'r--r--r--' and O_WRONLY throws a permissions error.

    The backup is created around line 127, the `re.sub()` calls
    fails (working on that), the `except` block fires and moves the backup
    file back, then the finally block tries to remove the non-existent
    backup file.

    * Exodus: skip the -G ""Unix Makefiles"" part
    
    The problem is that spack passes -G ""Unix Makefiles"" into cmake, which normally
    works. But in the Exodus package, it is being passed into a bash wrapper
    script. In there, the $@ then loses the information about ""Unix Makefiles""
    being just one argument, and in effect passes -G Unix Makefiles into the cmake
    (without quotes), and so cmake only sees -G Unix, and then fails. This is a
    known problem with bash with no simple solutions. As a workaround, this patch
    skips the first two arguments, i.e., -G and ""Unix Makefiles"". This makes it
    work.
    
    Fixes #5895.
    
    * Port exodusii to cmake
    
    The cmake options were taken from the cmake-exodus bash script and ported to

    fine perl or python.  Fix the dependency and clean up the sbang lines.
    
    * Fix python exe name, avoid path banging
    
    I'd cut and pasted the python bit from the perl bit and missed one
    reference to perl.
    
    While I'm there, use the cleaner `spec['perl'].command` instead of
    banging together the path from its bits.

    This adds it back so that if a user invokes 'spack load foo' without
    having sourced an environment setup script, they will be prompted
    to do so. This also improves the placeholder message to tell the
    user to invoke 'spack' as shell function rather than as an executable.

    * petsc: use the fact that hdf5/package.py has a hard dependency on zlib [so no need to check for this dependency in code]
    
    recommended-by: @davydden
    
    * petsc: change hdf5 dependency to 'hdf5+hl' as petsc configure is looing for -lhdf5_hl

    This should reduce the delay the users experience when sourcing the

    that will be evaluated.

    * xsdk:  Added MFEM rc package.
    
    * xsdk: add version entry for xsdk-0.3.0-rc1 - and set it as preferred version
    
    * xsdk: remove 'xsdk' from version - recommended by Todd.
    
    Now the usage is:
     'spack install xsdk@0.3.0-rc1'
    
    instead of the previous usage:
     'spack install xsdk@xsdk-0.2.0'
    
    * xsdk: add petsc@3.8.0 as a dependency for xsdk-0.3.0-rc1
    
    * mfem: fix dependency to use the corrected xsdk version
    
    * Updated the mfem version tags.
    
    * mfem: fix merge

    * pflotran: update to release branch
    
    * plasma: fix spec -> self.spec
    
    * Changes to enable mfem hooks into hypre, superlu-dist, and petsc.  Sundials hooks may come in the future.
    
    * adding plasma with comment
    
    * Bumped the version of mfem up to handle integration with sundials3.0.0.  Also enabled hypre in sundials.
    
    * Turn on the plasma package definition for testing
    
    * Fix conflict declaration to obey ordering rules
    
    * xsdk: udate superlu-dist dependency to v5.2.2
    
    * plasma: change gcc dependency to workarround potential spack bug #5778
    
    * trilinos: update hdf5 dependency to use 'hdf5+hl'
    
    Without this change - I get the following error [triggered by 161dca6d5 c9810f808 changes]
    
    $ ./bin/spack install trilinos+hdf5

    * plasma: add in -lm dependency per #6046
    
    * update sundials version to 3.0.0
    
    * Add fixes to support Netlib LAPACK
    
    * mfem does not use cmake for builds [anymore] - so remove code corresponding to this dependency.
    
    This enables mfem build on OSX [with xcode/clang compilers]
    
    * mfem: update to v3.3.2-rc4
    
    * add patch for building sundials on mac
    
    * xsdk: enable plasma for gcc-4.9+ - same as what plasma/package.py does.
    
    * magma: Fix for cuda-9.0  as it does not support sm20
    
    nvcc fatal   : Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_20'
    
    * add in code for 'spack install xsdk+cuda' - which installs magma
    
    * fix flake8 warning
    
    * fix flake8 warnings
    
    * Updated to the latest MFEM RC.
    
    * alquimia: fix to use petsc-3.8.0+ versions
    
    * petsc: update to version 3.8.1
    
    * petsc: add in conflict between petsc-3.8.0 & mkl
    
    * xsdk: update petsc to 3.8.1 to get MKL build fix
    
    * petsc: fix superlu_dist dependency
    
    * petsc: when hdf5 depends on zlib - petsc+hdf5 should also be configured with zlib
    
    * petsc: fix dependency [of zlib to be on hdf5 - and not on petsc]
    
    * petsc: fix pkgconfig error - with incorrect library link order that can break mfem examples with static build
    
    * petsc: use the fact that hdf5/package.py has a hard dependency on zlib [so no need to check for this dependency in code]
    
    recommended-by: @davydden
    
    * petsc: change hdf5 dependency to 'hdf5+hl' as petsc configure is looing for -lhdf5_hl
    
    https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/5846
    
    * plasma: also detect -lgfortran
    
    * update sundials version to 3.1.0

    This reverts commit d1afa8c20d4313fdc42a27e5380573b035b32998.
    
    * xsdk: update to use petsc-3.8.2
    
    * Fixed a problem with MFEM trying to use mpicxx instead of the spack defined compiler.
    
    * Minor changes to the mfem build and pointing at mfem's release branch that is currently undergoing internal testing.
    
    * Enabling shared build for Plasma
    
    * plasma: do not look for libgfortran on cray - spack finds the wrong one from the frontend
    
    '-L/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.3 -L/usr/lib64 -lgfortran'
    
    * Some changes to the mfem package that are in the process of being pulled into spack/develop.
    
    * xsdk: switch from 0.3.0-rc1 to 0.3.0
    
    * fix flake8 warnings
    
    * plasma: extract plasma changes from xsdk-0.3.0
    
    * plasma: cleanup per review
    - netlib-lapack: add support for spec['lapack:c'].libs, spec['blas:c'].libs
    - add getblaslapacklibs() to eliminate duplicate code in edit() and build_targets()
    - eliminate string manipulation of ld_flags
    
    - remove gfortran check (will check later)
    - remove build() (will check later)

    * Support pruning of vars with Env from_sourcing_file (issue #6501)
    
    - Blacklist string literals or regular expressions of environment
      variables that are to be removed from consideration as being affect
      by the sourcing of the file. Conversely, whitelist modifications
      that should not ignored.  Whitelisted variables have priority over
      blacklisting.
      Eg,
    
          EnvironmentModifications.from_sourcing_file
          (
              bashrc
              blacklist=['JUNK_ENV', 'OPTIONAL_.*'],
              whitelist=['OPTIONAL_REQUIRED.*']
          )
    
    This modification can be used to eliminate environment variables that
    are not generalized for modules (eg, user-specific variables).
    
    * BUG: module prepend-path in wrong order (fixes #6501)
    
    * STYLE: module variables in sorted order (issue #6501)
    
    - looks nicer and also helps when comparing the contents of different
      module files.
    
    * ENH: remove duplicates from env paths when creating modules (issue #6501)
    
    - this makes for a cleaner module environment and helps avoid some
      unnecessary changes to the environment that are only provoked by
      redundancies in the PATH.
    
      eg,
          before PATH=/usr/bin
          after  PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/my/application/bin
    
      should only result in /my/application/bin being added to the PATH
      and not /usr/bin:/my/application/bin
    
    Activate via the 'clean' flag (default: False):

12,20,Wednesday,2017,15,"    Compiler flag handlers (#6415)
    
    This adds the ability for packages to apply compiler flags in one of
    three ways: by injecting them into the compiler wrapper calls (the
    default in this PR and previously the only automated choice);
    exporting environment variable definitions for variables with
    corresponding names (e.g. CPPFLAGS=...); providing them as arguments
    to the build system (e.g. configure).
    
    When applying compiler flags using build system arguments, a package
    must implement the 'flags_to_build_system_args"" function. This is
    provided for CMake and autotools packages, so for packages which
    subclass those build systems, they need only update their flag
    handler method specify which compiler flags should be specified as
    arguments to the build system.
    
    Convenience methods are provided to specify that all flags be applied
    in one of the 3 available ways, so a custom implementation is only
    required if more than one method of applying compiler flags is
    needed.
    
    This also removes redundant build system definitions from tutorial
    examples

    + For now, provide a `build_type=` variant similar what is found in
      CMakePackage.
    + There is a potential for duplicate specification of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` if both

      arguments provided to cmake.  Specifying this variant no longer appends this
      configure option.  However, if `+debug` is specified, require

    Spack needs to pass information about where the linker
    can find `libintl`.  We're currently using `LDFLAGS` to do so.
    The `LDFLAGS` info is pasted into the command line upstream
    of the a file (`libgit.a`) that includes unresolved symbols that
    need that library.  This fails on Ubuntu, although it seems to
    work on CentOS (see #6841).

    On Darwin and other BSD systems, the system 'libtool' and 'libtoolize'

    A problem with the current libtool package is that it installs the GNU
    libtool commands as 'libtool' and 'libtoolize', respectively, but
    build systems on BSD platforms will attempt to run 'glibtool' and
    'glibtoolize'. The expedient solution to this problem is to symlink
    'libtool' to 'glibtool' and 'libtoolize' to 'glibtoolize', because

    This attempts to address one of the complaints at #5996 (comment):
    
    > Repo currently caches package instances by Spec, and those Package instances have a Spec.
    > This is unnecessary and causes confusion. I think I thought that we'd need to cache instances
    > after loading package classes, but really just caching the classes is fine.
    
    With this update, Repo's package cache is removed and Specs cache the package reference themselves. One consequence is that Specs which compare as equal will store separate instances of a Package class (not doing this creates issues for #4595 (comment)).
    
    There were several references to Spec.package that could be replaced with Spec.package_class without any additional modifications. There are still a couple remaining references to Spec.package in Spec that would require adding functionality before replacing (e.g. calling Package.provides and Package.installed).
    
    Note this makes it difficult to mock fetchers for tests which invokes code that reconstructs specs. test_packaging was one example of this where the updates caused a failure (in that case the error was avoided by not making an unnecessary call).
    
    Details:
    * Replace instances of spec.package with spec.package_class where a class method is being called
    * Remove instances of Repo.get where Spec.package_class can be used in its place
    * remove Repo.get caching instances of Package class for specs
    * remove redundant check (which is also incorrect now that each spec stores its own copy of its package)
    * avoid creating mirror with specs because it copies specs and those copies dont refer to the mocked fetcher (and it is also not required for the test)
    * remove checks that are no longer necessary since repo doesn't cache specs

1,31,Wednesday,2018,2,"    Improve log parsing performance (#7093)
    
    * Allow dashes in command names and fix command name handling
    
    - Command should allow dashes in their names like the reest of spack,
      e.g. `spack log-parse`
      - It might be too late for `spack build-cache` (since it is already
        called `spack buildcache`), but we should try a bit to avoid
        inconsistencies in naming conventions
    
    - The code was inconsistent about where commands should be called by
      their python module name (e.g. `log_parse`) and where the actual
      command name should be used (e.g. `log-parse`).
    
    - This made it hard to make a command with a dash in the name, and it
      made `SpackCommand` fail to recognize commands with dashes.
    
    - The code now uses the user-facing name with dashes for function
      parameters, then converts that the module name when needed.
    
    * Improve performance of log parsing
    
    - A number of regular expressions from ctest_log_parser have really poor
      performance, most due to untethered expressions with * or + (i.e., they
      don't start with ^, so the repetition has to be checked for every
      position in the string with Python's backtracking regex implementation)
    
    - I can't verify that CTest's regexes work with an added ^, so I don't
      really want to touch them.  I tried adding this and found that it
      caused some tests to break.
    
    - Instead of using only ""efficient"" regular expressions, Added a
      prefilter() class that allows the parser to quickly check a
      precondition before evaluating any of the expensive regexes.
    
    - Preconditions do things like check whether the string contains ""error""
      or ""warning"" (linear time things) before evaluating regexes that would
      require them.  It's sad that Python doesn't use Thompson string
      matching (see https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html)
    
    - Even with Python's slow implementation, this makes the parser ~200x
      faster on the input we tried it on.
    
    * Add `spack log-parse` command and improve the display of parsed logs
    
    - Add better coloring and line wrapping to the log parse output.  This
      makes nasty build output look better with the line numbers.
    
    - `spack log-parse` allows the log parsing logic used at the end of
      builds to be executed on arbitrary files, which is handy even outside
      of spack.
    
    - Also provides a profile option -- we can profile arbitrary files and
      show which regular expressions in the magic CTest parser take the most
      time.
    
    * Parallelize log parsing
    
    - Log parsing now uses multiple threads for long logs
    - Lines from logs are divided into chnks and farmed out to <ncpus>
    - Add -j option to `spack log-parse`

    When activating extensions in external views, the --ignore-conflicts

    for the duplicate __init__ file for multiple python packages in the

    cause an error whether or not --ignore-conflicts was set.
    
    This also renames the 'force' option of do_activate to
    'with_dependencies' and updates views to call do_activate with this
    set to False (since it traverses the dependency dag anyway). This
    isn't strictly required, it just avoids redundant calls.

    Prior to this commit, running `spack module refresh` with `gdbm`
    installed throws the warning:
    
    ```console
    ==> Warning: Could not write module file [/Users/oxberry1/spack/share/spack/lmod/darwin-sierra-x86_64/Core/gdbm/1.14.1.lua]
    ==> Warning:    --> global name 'spack_cc' is not defined <--
    ```
    
    This warning is repeated for every `gdbm` installation in Spack.
    
    The cause of the issue seems to be the same as in spack/spack (#6089):
    using `spack_cc`, `spack_cxx`, or similar inside `configure_args`
    causes the warnings to throw when module files are generated.
    
    Moving the use of `spack_cc` into `setup_environment` seems to fix the
    problem, even though it's a bit of a kludge.

    Running `spack module refresh -m lmod --delete-tree -y` throws the
    following warning:
    
    ```console
    ==> Warning: Could not write module file [/Users/oxberry1/spack/share/spack/lmod/darwin-sierra-x86_64/openblas/0.2.20-ibhtl5q/clang/5.0.1/ipopt/3.12.9.lua]
    ==> Warning:    --> global name 'prefix' is not defined <--
    ```
    
    This warning arises because the variable expansions in
    `spack.modules.BaseFileWriter` occur at module/package scope. Even
    though `prefix` is an argument to `install` methods in e.g.,
    `MakefilePackage`, so using this argument within package methods is
    legal, doing so defeats the introspection logic in
    `spack.modules.BaseFileWriter`. Replacing `prefix` with `self.prefix`
    resolves the problem, because the introspection logic in
    `spack.modules.BaseFileWriter` can use introspection to query IPOPT's
    prefix.

    Fixes #7237
    Fixes #6404
    Fixes #6418
    Fixes #6369
    
    Identify when binary relocation fails to remove all instances of the
    source prefix (and report an error to the user unless they specify
    -a to allow the old root to appear). This check occurs at two stages:
    during ""bincache create"" all instances of the root are replaced with
    a special placeholder string (""@@@@...""), and a failure occurs if the
    root is detected at this point; when the binary package is extracted
    there is a second check. This addresses #7237 and #6418.
    
    This is intended to be compatible with previously-created binary
    packages.
    
    This also adds:
    
    * Better error messages for ""spack install --use-cache"" (#6404)
    * Faster relocation on Mac OS (using a single call to
      install_name_tool for all files rather than a call for each file)
    * Clean up when ""buildcache create"" fails (addresses #6369)
    * Explicit error message when the spack instance extracting the binary
      package uses a different install layout than the spack instance that
      created the binary package (since this is currently not supported)
    * Remove the option to create unsigned binary packages with -y

    This adds a guard in the initializer to convert '-' to '_'.

    source prefix matched the destination prefix, which no longer
    matters since the source prefix is replaced with a placeholder
    (so it always needs to be updated); it also would skip relocation
    if the rpaths were not relative, when in fact it should be the
    opposite (binaries without relative rpaths *should* be relocated,
    and those without don't need it).

    * Reverting Mac-related CUDA checks in the OCCA and MAGMA packages.
    
    A much better solution is to install CUDA manually and add it to
    ~/.spack/darwin/packages.yaml:
    
    packages:
        cuda:
            paths:
                cuda@8.0.54: /usr/local/cuda

    * Added libceed package and made changes to get the ceed metapackage up and running.
    
    * Get the ceed package up and running and added installing the .h file in the libceed package.
    
    * All packages are now pointed at specific versions (either tagged or git hashed.
    
    * Changed some of the specific versions in the CEED metapackage.
    
    * Some version updates.
    
    * Applied Cameron Smith's patch for the latest pumi.
    
    * Merge
    
    * Nek5000: Use tarball instead of git tag
    
    * Major update of the mfem package - needs more testing. Add a testing
    shell script for mfem, test_builds.sh, in the mfem directory. It builds
    a number of mfem configurations to ensure they all work.
    
    Add 'suite-sparse' variant to petsc.
    
    Add 'develop' version of libceed.
    
    Add 'metis' variant of laghos.
    
    Update the dependencies of ceed.
    
    * Changes in petsc's handling of zlib to make the latest build work on Mac.
    
    * [MFEM] When using '+libunwind', mfem needs '-ldl'.
    
    * [OCCA] Remove debug print statements.
    
    * [PETSc] Replace the check ('zlib' in spec) with ('+zlib' in spec) - the
    latter checks if 'zlib' variant of petsc is enabled which is incorrect;
    the former checks if petsc is configured to depend on 'zlib'.
    
    * [MFEM] Add conduit variant.
    
    * [libCEED] Enable testing using 'make prove'.
    
    * [MFEM] Tweak test_builds.sh - all builds pass on fedora 27.
    
    * Add a post install test
    
    * Add a post installation check for NekCEM
    
    * pumi: bump git hash, remove unused patch
    
    * Fixed testing of Laghos package
    
    * Adding variants in CEED package
    
    * Empty file for URL didn't work on LLNL/LC. Replacing with bundle-package.txt -> README.md.
    
    * [MFEM] If the spec defines the 'cxxflags' compiler flags, use that value
    to set the CXXFLAGS value in the mfem build system.
    
    * Disabling HDF5 by default.
    
    You can still build it with ""spack install ceed+hdf5"".
    
    * libceed: fix use of prefix versus DESTDIR
    
    * Added cuda variant for libCEED (off by default)
    
    * [libCEED] When building v0.1, fix ceed.pc before installing it.
    
    * [CEED] Add variants for OCCA and PUMI. Replace the hdf5 variant with
    a variant called quickbuild that disables variants in packages to
    speedup the build - currently hdf5, boost, and superlu-dist in PETSc.
    
    * [libCEED] Remove unused 'import os'.
    
    * [MAGMA] Add version 2.3.0.
    
    * [OCCA] Major update of occa/package.py.
    
    * [libCEED] Several improvements.
    
    * [CEED] Use fixed versions for occa and libceed.
    
    * [OCCA] Fix a bug in CUDA setup.
    
    * NekCEM doesn't need depends_on('python')
    
    * [OCCA,libCEED,MFEM,CEED] Update occa and libceed versions plus a few
    tweaks in occa and mfem.
    
    * Switching to gslib-1.0.2 to fix summitdev bug.
    
    * [Nek5000] Use the Fortran 77 compiler instead of the 'fc' compiler.
    Propagate any 'fflags' and 'cflags' specifications to the Nek tools.
    
    * [MFEM] Tweak for 'ppc64le'.
    
    * attempt to override fips compatibility error for md5
    
    * Compiler option changes in libCEED to fix summitdev build.
    
    * Disable the nekcem install test until it can be fixed.
    
    * [NekCEM] Major update of the package to fix various issues.
    
    * [NekCEM] Fix formatting
    
    * zoltan: remove non-portable -g0 flag
    
    the pgi compiler does not accept it
    
    * pumi: specify dependency on cmake > 3
    
    * [Nek5000] Add dependency on libx11 when needed. Various hacks to
    support IBM XL compilers.
    
    * [NekCEM] Link with the pthreads library - it is required.
    
    * [MAGMA] Add a patch for magma v2.3.0 when building with gcc <= 4.8.
    Add dependency on BLAS.
    
    * [CEED] Update to magma 2.3.0. When building with gcc < 4.9 constrain
    the used suite-sparse version to <= 5.1.0 - starting with v5.2.0,
    suite-sparse requires gcc >= 4.9.
    
    * Small updates
    
    * [libceed, gslib] Fix style
    
    * [Nek5000] Need 'libxt' as a dependency as well.
    
    * [MUMPS] Temporary workaround for ray.
    
    * Updating occa and libceed to laters pre-1.0.0 and pre-0.2 hashes
    
    * petsc: add pkg-config patch for variable quoting
    
    Variable definitions in pkg-config are processed more like make than a
    shell, so don't need quoting.  Older versions of pkg-config (<= 0.28)
    did not remove the quotes when printing the value.

    Reported-by: Tzanio Kolev <kolev1@llnl.gov>
    
    * petsc: add 3.8.4 and myself as co-maintainer
    
    * Updating libceed to latest pre-0.2 hash.
    
    * [PETSc] Add the 'headers' and 'libs' properties.
    
    * [MFEM] Explicitly add rpaths to link flags for external packages.
    This is necessary when MFEM's exported options (in config.mk) are
    used outside of Spack for linking against MFEM.
    
    * Unset MFEM_DIR before building MFEM
    
    * [PETSc] As observed by @jedbrown, there is no need to define the 'libs'
    property explicitly - the default handler works fine too.
    
    * Build MAGMA shared by default, install a few additional headers
    
    * Forgot a self
    
    * Switching to OCCA tag v1.0.0-alpha.4.
    
    Adding urls for OCCA and libCEED ('spack uninstall' complains otherwise).
    
    * Removed FIXMEs for OCCA tag
    
    * [occa] Cleaned up tagged versions
    
    * [libceed] Updated occa to v1.0.0-alpha.5
    
    * [ceed] Updated occa to v1.0.0-alpha.5
    
    * [libCEED] Always define the 'NDEBUG' makefile option based on the
    'debug' variant setting - this should always work regardless of the
    default setting inside the libceed makefile.
    
    * [MUMPS] Revert a temporary workaround.
    
    * [CEED, libCEED] Minor tweaks.
    
    * libCEED v0.2 release
    
    * [CEED] Use version 0.2 of libCEED.
    
    * [HPGMG] Remove duplicate version.
    
    * [CEED] Update the hpgmg version
    
    * hpgmg: use tarball for 0.3
    
    The Git repository contains somewhat heavy documentation so the tarballs
    are much faster.
    
    * hpgmg: +fe was default for the 0.3 release
    
    * hpgmg: explicitly name build directory to avoid use of ambient PETSC_ARCH
    
    * [HPGMG] Fix flake8 formatting

4,26,Thursday,2018,1,"    mfem: add valid range of hypre version numbers (#7903)
    
    This commit fixes #7900.
    
    In short: in the absence of constraints to the contrary, spack will
    download the preferred version of a package, which is usually the most
    recent non-develop version. On a clean spack installation without
    hypre installed, `spack install mfem` will download hypre 2.14.0,
    which is API-incompatible with mfem 3.3.2 (and earlier versions of
    mfem), so spack will throw compiler errors re: the API mismatch.
    
    This commit fixes that error by restricting mfem release versions
    3.3.2 and earlier to hypre version 2.10.b to 2.13.999 (only 2.13.0
    currently exists, but if it has a non-2.14.x maintenance release,
    these versions of hypre should also be permitted).

    This PR introduces a new attribute for packages called

    a package build (e.g. the config.log generated during autotools
    builds).
    
    The attribute contains a list of glob expressions; Any file that
    matches will be archived in the `<prefix>/.spack/archived-files`
    directory. Errors that occur when archiving files are collected and
    reported in a file named `<prefix>/.spack/archived-files/errors.txt`.
    
    `AutotoolsPackage` and `CMakePackage` provide a sensible default
    override for this attribute.

5,10,Thursday,2018,16,"    init: move symbols in `spack` to `spack.pkgkit`
    
    - Spack packages were originally expected to call `from spack import *`
      themselves, but it has become difficult to manage imports in the
      Spack core.
    
    - the top-level namespace polluted by package symbols, and it's not
      possible to avoid circular dependencies and unnecessary module loads in
      the core, given all the stuff the packages need.
    
    - This makes the top-level `spack` package essentially empty, save for a
      version tuple and a version string, and `from spack import *` is now
      essentially a no-op.
    
    - The common routines and directives that packages need are now in
      `spack.pkgkit`, and the import system forces packages to automatically
      include this so that old packages that call `from spack import *`
      will continue to work without modification.
    
    - Since `from spack import *` is no longer required, we could consider
      removing ``from spack import *`` from packages in the future and
      shifting to ``from spack.pkgkit import *``, but we can wait a while to
      do this.

    choose one of several different implementations of a given function

    Flex 2.6.4 doesn't build with gcc@7:. This sets Flex 2.6.3 as the
    preferred version. The flex package had a conflict directive for
    this but originally the recorded conflict was specific to ubuntu;
    this appears to be an issue on multiple operating systems so this
    also updates the conflict to be more general and adds a comment
    which links to the relevant issues.

    * Add Tophat v2.1.2, fixes automake issues
    
    The Tophat team merged the patch from
    https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/8244 and release v2.1.2
    
    This change requires the old automake if you're building the older
    release and is relaxed about the automake it requires if you're
    building the v2.1.2 release.
    
    Building v2.1.1 and v2.1.2 works on a CentOS 7 system, I don't have
    the necessary bit to actually test the resulting binaries.
    
    Here's the commit note from the change that was ultimately merged
    upstream.
    
    Fixes #8025
    
    > Tophat was failing to build with automake@1.16.1, it worked with the
    > older automake@1.15.1. This commit adds a patch to Tophat's
    > src/Makefile.am which cleans up a few things. The result builds
    > successfully with both automake@1.15.1 and automake@1.16.1. I have no
    > way to check that the resulting builds Do The Right Thing.
    >
    > It changes two things:
    >
    > the original Makefile.am had a rule for $(SAMPROG) with no
    > actions, and since there was a directory there with a tempting name
    > the newer automake was trying to do something with it, but lacked
    > the appropriate clues. Since that target is actually made as a side
    > effect of making the library (sigh...), it seems to work to just
    > give that rule something harmless to do (the Peter Principle
    > triumphs again...).
    >
    > a bunch of the targets need a libtophat.a and libgc.a; the older
    > automake was probably able to guess what to do given the list of
    > sources but the newer automake apparently won't make the necessary
    > assumptions. This patch wires up a simple rule and cleans up the
    > appropriate dependencies so that things work.
    >
    > While it may appear that I'm someone who understands automake, keep in
    > mind that I only play such a person on a TV reality show. YMMV.

    5.0.0 causes build issues on Macs during the link of Camellia's drivers.  The issue is that we end up with -framework -lAccelerate in the link line, where it should read -framework Accelerate, I believe.  I'm not sure where this comes from, but 4.9.2 does not have this issue.
    
    * Trimmed slightly the Trilinos requirements.
    
    Also deleted a blank line that had spaces in it because the Travis-CI thing didn't like that.
    
    * Reduced length of MOAB description (Travis-CI complained).
    
    * Reduced the MOAB line further; didn't quite get there last time!
    
    This is to satisfy Travis-CI's requirement that the description be less than 80 characters long (E501).

    Trying to relocate a distribution when the new and old paths are
    equal leads to failure, because the test that ensures that no
    unrelocated bits are left over always fails. As an example, this
    occurs if a user installs a package, generates a binary with it
    using 'spack buildcache', uninstalls it, and then attempts to
    reinstall into the same spack installation using the generated
    binary package.
    
    This updates the relocation check to accept the presence of the
    old prefix in binaries if the package is being reinstalled into
    its original location.

6,6,Wednesday,2018,1,"    Fix bug where patches specified by dependents were not applied (#8272)
    
    Fixes #7885
    
    #7193 added the patches_to_apply function to collect patches which are then
    applied in Package.do_patch. However this only collects patches that are
    associated with the Package object and does not include Spec-related patches
    (which are applied by dependents, added in #5476).
    
    Spec.patches already collects patches from the package as well as those applied
    by dependents, so the Package.patches_to_apply function isn't necessary. All
    uses of Package.patches_to_apply are replaced with Package.spec.patches.
    
    This also updates Package.content_hash to require the associated spec to be
    concrete: Spec.patches is only set after concretization. Before this PR, it was
    possible for Package.content_hash to be valid before concretizing the associated
    Spec if all patches were associated with the Package (vs. being applied by
    dependents). This behavior was unreliable though so the change is unlikely to
    be disruptive.

    The following improvements are made to cxx standard support
    (e.g. compiler.cxxNN_flag functions) in compilers:
    
    * Add cxx98_flag property
    * Add support for throwing an exception when a flag is not supported (previously
      if a flag was not supported the application was terminated with tty.die)
    * The name of the flag associated with e.g. c++14 standard support changes for
      different compiler versions (e.g. c++1y vs c++14). This makes a few corrections
      on what flag to return for which version.
    * Added tests to confirm that versions report expected flags for various c++
      standards (or raise an exception for versions that don't provide a given cxx
      standard)
    
    Note that if a given cxx standard is the default, the associated flag property will
    return """"; cxx98 is assumed to be the default standard so this is the behavior for
    the associated property in the base compiler class.
    
    Package changes:
    
    * Improvements to the boost spec to take advantage of the improved standard
      flag facility.
    * Update the clingo spec to catch the new exception rather than look for an
      empty flag to indicate non-support (which is not part of the compiler flag API)

    https://root.cern.ch/download. However, https://root.cern.ch/download
    gives a 404, while https://root.cern.ch/download/ works just fine.
    
    Note that some servers *don't* work with a trailing slash, so this tries with and
    without the slash. This will double the number of URLs searched but the
    slowdown should only affect the ""spack versions"" command.

    - Adjust YAML format to be more generic
      - YAML spec-set format now has a `matrix` section, which can contain
        multiple lists of specs, generated different ways. Including:
        - specs: a raw list of specs.
        - packages: a list of package names and versions
        - compilers: a list of compiler names and versions
    
      - All of the elements of `matrix` are dimensions for the build matrix;
        we take the cartesian product of these lists of specs to generate a
        build matrix.  This means we can add things like [^mpich, ^openmpi]
        to get builds with different MPI versions.  It also means we can
        multiply the build matrix out with lots of different parameters.
    
    - Add a schema format for spec-sets

6,26,Tuesday,2018,6,"    views: packages can customize how they're added to views (#7152)
    
    Functional updates:
    
    - `python` now creates a copy of the `python` binaries when it is added
      to a view
    
    - Python extensions (packages which subclass `PythonPackage`) rewrite
      their shebang lines to refer to python in the view
    
    - Python packages in the same namespace will not generate conflicts if
      both have `...lib/site-packages/namespace-example/__init__.py`
    
      - These `__init__` files will also remain when removing any package in
        the namespace until the last package in the namespace is removed
    
    
    Generally (Updated 2/16):
    
    - Any package can define `add_files_to_view` to customize how it is added
      to a view (and at the moment custom definitions are included for
      `python` and `PythonPackage`)
    
      - Likewise any package can define `remove_files_from_view` to customize
        which files are removed (e.g. you don't always want to remove the
        namespace `__init__`)
    
    - Any package can define `view_file_conflicts` to customize what it
      considers a merge conflict
    
    - Global activations are handled like views (where the view root is the
      spec prefix of the extendee)
    
      - Benefit: filesystem-management aspects of activating extensions are
        now placed in views (e.g. now one can hardlink a global activation)
    
      - Benefit: overriding `Package.activate` is more straightforward (see
        `Python.activate`)
    
      - Complication: extension packages which have special-purpose logic
        *only* when activated outside of the extendee prefix must check for
        this in their `add_files_to_view` method (see `PythonPackage`)
    
    - `LinkTree` is refactored to have separate methods for copying a
      directory structure and for copying files (since it was found that
      generally packages may want to alter how files are copied but still
      wanted to copy directories in the same way)
    
    
    TODOs (updated 2/20):
    
    - [x] additional testing (there is some unit testing added at this point
      but more would be useful)
    
    - [x] refactor or reorganize `LinkTree` methods: currently there is a
      separate set of methods for replicating just the directory structure
      without the files, and a set for replicating everything
    
    - [x] Right now external views (i.e. those not used for global
      activations) call `view.add_extension`, but global activations do not
      to avoid some extra work that goes into maintaining external views. I'm
      not sure if addressing that needs to be done here but I'd like to
      clarify it in the comments (UPDATE: for now I have added a TODO and in
      my opinion this can be merged now and the refactor handled later)
    
    - [x] Several method descriptions (e.g. for `Package.activate`) are out
      of date and reference a distinction between global activations and
      views, they need to be updated
    
    - [x] Update aspell package activations

      special adjustments for compiling with spack.

    - the different combinations of paraview backends, off-screen etc

      a standard dependency makes much sense.

7,17,Tuesday,2018,0,"    Add documentation on build systems (#5015)
    
    Spack provides a number of classes based on commonly-used build systems
    that users can extend when writing packages; the classes provide functionality
    to perform the actions relevant to the build system (e.g. running ""configure"" for
    an Autotools-based package). This adds documentation for classes supporting the
    following build systems:
    
    * Makefile
    * Autotools
    * CMake
    * QMake
    * SCons
    * Waf
    
    This includes build systems for managing extensions of the following packages:
    
    * Perl
    * Python
    * R
    * Octave
    
    This also adds documentation on implementing packages that use a custom build
    system (e.g. Perl/CMake).
    
    Spack also provides extendable classes which aggregate functionality for related
    sets of packages, e.g. those using CUDA. Documentation is added for
    CudaPackage.

      URL fetcher AND for a git fetcher:
    
      version('1.0', md5='abc123', git='https://foo.bar', commit='feda2343')
    
    - Now, we check the arguments before constructing a fetcher, to ensure
      that each package has *only* arguments for a single type of fetcher.
    
    - Also added `test_package_version_consistency()` to the `package_sanity`
      test, so that all builtin packages are required to have valid
      `version()` directives.

8,1,Wednesday,2018,1,"    cc: package search paths come before dependency paths (#4692)
    
    Spack currently prepends include paths, library paths, and rpaths to the compile line.  This causes problems when a header or library in the package has the same name as one exported by one of its dependencies.  The *dependency's* header will be preferred over the package's, which is not what most builds expect.  This also breaks some of our production codes.
    
    This restores the original cc behavior (from *very* early Spack) of parsing compiler arguments out by type (`-L`, `-I`, `-Wl,-rpath`) and reconstituting the full command at the end.
    
    `<includes> <other_args> <library dirs> <rpaths>`
    
    This differs from the original behavior in one significant way, though: it *appends* the library arguments so that dependency libraries do not shadow those in the build.
    
    This is safe because semantics aren't affected by *interleaving* `-I`, `-L`, and `-Wl,-rpath` arguments with others, only with each other (so the order fo two `-L` args affects the search path, but we search for all libraries on the command line using the same search path).
    
    We preserve the following:
    1. Any system directory in the paths will be listed last.
    2. The root package's include/library/RPATH flags come before flags of the same type for any dependency.
    3. Order will be preserved within flags passed by the build (except system paths, which are moved to be last)
    4. Flags for dependencies will appear between the root flags and the system flags, and the flags for any dependency will come before those for *its* dependencies (this is for completeness -- we already guarantee this in `build_environment.py`)

    package.py to allow it to use IBM XL Fortran for linking. It also
    eliminates the need for the existing MUMPS IBM XL patches by having
    package.py specify the compiler-dependent ""shared"" flag to the
    linker, and always using the compiler suite's Fortran compiler
    for linking.

8,4,Saturday,2018,1,"    Restore cc: package search paths come before dependency paths (#4692)
    
    Spack currently prepends include paths, library paths, and rpaths to the
    compile line.  This causes problems when a header or library in the package
    has the same name as one exported by one of its dependencies.  The
    *dependency's* header will be preferred over the package's, which is not
    what most builds expect.  This also breaks some of our production codes.
    
    This restores the original cc behavior (from *very* early Spack) of parsing
    compiler arguments out by type (`-L`, `-I`, `-Wl,-rpath`) and reconstituting
    the full command at the end.
    
    `<includes> <other_args> <library dirs> <rpaths>`
    
    This differs from the original behavior in one significant way, though: it
    *appends* the library arguments so that dependency libraries do not shadow
    those in the build.
    
    This is safe because semantics aren't affected by *interleaving* `-I`, `-L`,
    and `-Wl,-rpath` arguments with others, only with each other (so the order of
    two `-L` args affects the search path, but we search for all libraries on the
    command line using the same search path).
    
    We preserve the following:
    1. Any system directory in the paths will be listed last.
    2. The root package's include/library/RPATH flags come before flags of the
       same type for any dependency.
    3. Order will be preserved within flags passed by the build (except system
       paths, which are moved to be last)
    4. Flags for dependencies will appear between the root flags and the system
       flags, and the flags for any dependency will come before those for *its*
       dependencies (this is for completeness -- we already guarantee this in
       `build_environment.py`)

    * Add package for fasta
    
    Add a package for the fasta sequence alignment tools.
    
    The build system is novel (fasta is ""venerable"", so...).  The source
    tree includes nearly 50 variant Makefiles, the installer is expected
    to pick one that's appropriate and then edit the ""XDIR"" variable to
    specify the installation path.  I can only test 64 bit darwin and
    linux, so that's all I've included.  I'm also assuming that every
    64bit x86 system we'll see supports the SSE2 extensions.  Other
    situations can be dealt with when someone has a test case.

    - Clean up the description
    - Switch to MakefilePackage
      - generalize the path to the chosen Makefile
      - implement separate `edit`, `build`, and `install` phases.

      lower-level access to the import implementation.

8,17,Friday,2018,13,"    install_tree: symlink handling and add 'ignore' option (#9019)
    
    Fixes #9001
    
    #8289 added support for install_tree and copy_tree to merge into an existing
    directory structure. However, it did not properly handle relative symlinks and
    also removed support for the 'ignore' keyword. Additionally, some of the tests
    were overly-strict when checking the permissions on the copied files.
    
    This updates the install_tree/copy_tree methods and their tests:
    
    * copy_tree/install_tree now preserve relative link targets (if the symlink in the
      source directory structure is relative, the symlink created in the destination
      will be relative)
    * Added support for 'ignore' argument back to copy_tree/install_tree (removed
      in #8289). It is no longer the object output by shutil.ignore_patterns: you pass a
      function that accepts a path relative to the source and returns whether that
      path should be copied.
    * The openfoam packages (currently the only ones making use of the 'ignore'
      argument) are updated for the new API
    * When a symlink target is absolute, copy_tree and install_tree now rewrite the
      source prefix to be the destination prefix
    * copy_tree tests no longer check permissions: copy_tree doesn't enforce
      anything about permissions so its tests don't check for that
    * install_tree tests no longer check for exact permission matching since it can add
      file permissions

    #8223 replaced regex-based makefile target parsing with an invocation of
    ""make -q"". #8818 discovered that ""make -q"" can result in an error for some
    packages.
    
    Also, the ""make -q"" strategy relied on interpreting the error code, which only
    worked for GNU Make and not BSD Make (which was deemed acceptable at
    the time). As an added bonus, this implementation ignores the exit code and
    instead parses STDERR for any indications that the target does not exist; this
    works for both GNU Make and BSD Make.
    
    #8223 also updated ninja target detection to use ""ninja -t targets"". This does
    not change that behavior but makes it more-explicit with ""ninja -t targets all""
    
    This also adds tests for detection of ""make"" and ""ninja"" targets.

9,5,Wednesday,2018,5,"    Spack environment updates take precedence (#9107)
    
    Spack originally handled environment modifications in the following
    order:
    
     1. clear environment variables
        (unless Spack was invoked with --dirty)
     2. apply spack-specific environment variable updates,
        including variables set by Spack core like CC/PKG_CONFIG_PATH
            and those set by installed dependencies (e.g. in
            setup_dependent_environment)
     3. load all external/compiler modules
    
    1 and 2 were done together. This splits 1 into its own function and
    imposes the following order for environment modifications:
    
     1. clear environment variables
     2. load all external/compiler modules
     3. apply spack-specific environment variable updates
    
    As a result, prepend-path actions taken by Spack (or installed Spack
    dependencies) take precedence over prepend-path actions from compiler
    and external modules. Additionally, when Spack (or a package
    dependency) sets/unsets an environment variable, that will override
    the actions of external/compiler modules.

    Improve Spack's parsing of module show to eliminate some false
    positives (e.g. accepting MODULEPATH when it is in fact looking for
    PATH). This makes the following changes:
    
    * Updates the pattern searching for several paths to avoid the case
      where they are prefixes of unwanted paths
    * Adds a warning message when an extracted path doesn't exist (which
      may help catch future module parsing bugs faster)

    - Many container builds are timing out frequently during Spack tests in

    - Travis recommends to try `sudo: required` to see whether this is an
      infrastructure issue or something else.
    
    - added `sudo: required` to all Linux builds.
    
    - added --verbose to `spack test` invocation so that we can see more

9,25,Tuesday,2018,0,"    Increase and customize lock timeouts (#9219)
    
    Fixes #9166
    
    This is intended to reduce errors related to lock timeouts by making
    the following changes:
    
    * Improves error reporting when acquiring a lock fails (addressing
      #9166) - there is no longer an attempt to release the lock if an
      acquire fails
    * By default locks taken on individual packages no longer have a
      timeout. This allows multiple spack instances to install overlapping
      dependency DAGs. For debugging purposes, a timeout can be added by
      setting 'package_lock_timeout' in config.yaml
    * Reduces the polling frequency when trying to acquire a lock, to
      reduce impact in the case where NFS is overtaxed. A simple
      adaptive strategy is implemented, which starts with a polling
      interval of .1 seconds and quickly increases to .5 seconds
      (originally it would poll up to 10^5 times per second).
      A test is added to check the polling interval generation logic.
    * The timeout for Spack's whole-database lock (e.g. for managing
      information about installed packages) is increased from 60s to
      120s
    * Users can configure the whole-database lock timeout using the
      'db_lock_timout' setting in config.yaml
    
    Generally, Spack locks (those created using spack.llnl.util.lock.Lock)
    now have no timeout by default
    
    This does not address implementations of NFS that do not support file
    locking, or detect cases where services that may be required
    (nfslock/statd) aren't running.
    
    Users may want to be able to more-aggressively release locks when
    they know they are the only one using their Spack instance, and they
    encounter lock errors after a crash (e.g. a remote terminal disconnect
    mentioned in #8915).

    * libMesh will now used a copy of perl installed by spack instead of
      trying to find the system copy.

    * Record stdout for packages without errors
    
      Previously our reporter only stored stdout if something went wrong
      while installing a package.  This prevented us from properly reporting
      on steps where everything went as expected.
    
    * More robustly report all phases to CDash
    
      Previously if a phase generated no output it would not be reported to CDash.
      For example, consider the following output:
    
        ==> Executing phase: 'configure'
        ==> Executing phase: 'build'
    
      This would not generate a report for the configure phase. Now it does.
    
    * Add test case for CDash reporting clean builds
    
    * Fix default directory for CDash reports
    
      The default 'cdash_report' directory name was getting overwritten
      by 'junit-report'.
    
    * Upload the build phase first to CDash
    
      Older versions of CDash expect Build.xml to be the first file uploaded
      for any given build.
    
    * Define cdash_phase before referring to it

    - Delete references to ruamel.yaml at Spack start-up, if they are present
    
    - ruamel.yaml generates a .pth file when installed via pip that has the
      effect of always preferring the version of this package installed at
      site scope (effectively preventing us from vendoring it).
    
    - This mechanism triggers when implicitly importing the 'site' module
      when the python interpreter is started. In this PR we explicitly delete
      references to 'ruamel.yaml' and 'ruamel' in sys.modules, if any, after
      we set 'sys.path' to search from the directory where we store vendored
      packages. This ensures that the imports after those statements will be
      done from our vendored version.

11,21,Wednesday,2018,1,"    dyninst: overhaul package.py to CMakePackage (#9871)
    
    Drop versions 8.1.x.  These were > 5 years old, no other spack package
    uses them, and they used autotools.  Packages 'stat' and 'mitos' still
    use 8.2.1, so we keep that.
    
    Switch class Dyninst to CMakePackage.
    
    Clean up how the versions depend on various packages.  For example,
    Dyninst used libelf up to 9.2, and then elfutils starting with 9.3.
    This makes things easier going forward.
    
    Add variant 'openmp' (default True) to enable openmp support for
    ParseAPI.  This was added in 10.0.0.
    
    Add variant 'static' (default False) to also build static libraries.
    This goes back to 9.1.0.
    
    Disable cotire for the 9.3.x versions.  Cotire has no real use in a
    one-time build and can break parallel builds with both static and
    shared libs.

    * CGNS: Add option for 64-bit integers
    
    Added the `int64` variant which will build the library using 64-bit integers for certain values.  This gives the capability to have models with more than 2 billion cells and/or nodes.
    
    Beginning with CGNS-3.1.0, two new typedef variables have been introduced to support 64-bit mode. The `cglong_t` typedef is always a 64-bit integer, and `cgsize_t` will be either a 32-bit or 64-bit integer depending on how the library was built. Many of the C functions in the MLL have been changed to to use `cgsize_t` instead of `int` in the arguments. These functions include any that may exceed the 2Gb limit of an` int`, e.g. zone dimensions, element data, boundary conditions, and connectivity. In Fortran, all integer data is taken to be `integer*4` for 32-bit and `integer*8` for 64-bit builds.

    * EXODUS: Update version and dependencies
    
    Allow pulling master version from git.  Note that I hope to have better versioning ""soon""
    
    Add requirement to use Netcdf-4.6.1 or later as those versions no longer require changing the `maxdims` or `maxvars` defines in the netcdf.h include file.  With these versions, Exodus can use an unmodified NetCDF.  These versions of NetCDF are also better than previous versions (code quality, performance, robustness).
    
    It is still possible to run exodusII with previous NetCDF versions, but I don't know how to specify that the dependency where maxdims/maxvars variants are only needed for versions prior to 4.6.0.
    
    I also removed the explicit dependency on HDF5 as that dependency should be applied through the NetCDF dependency.

    * This fixes a number of bugs:
    
      * Patches were not properly downloaded and added to mirrors.
    
      * Mirror create didn't respect `list_url` in packages
    
      * Update the `spack mirror` command to add all packages in the
        concretized DAG (where originally it only added the package specified
        by the user). This is required in order to collect patches that are specified
        by dependents. Example:
          * if X->Y and X requires a patch on Y called Pxy, then Pxy will only
            be discovered if you create a mirror with X.
    
      * replace confusing --one-version-per-spec option for `spack mirror create`
        with --versions-per-spec; support retrieving multiple versions for
        concrete specs
    
    * Implementation details:
    
      * `spack mirror create` now uses regular staging logic to download files
        into a mirror, instead of reimplementing it in `add_single_spec`.
    
      * use a separate resource caching object to keep track of new
        resources and already-existing resources; also accepts storing
        resources retrieved from a cache (unlike the local cache)
    
      * mirror cache object now stores resources that are considered
        non-cachable, like (e.g. the tip of a branch);
    
      * the 'create' function of the mirror module no longer traverses
        dependencies since this was already handled by the 'mirror' command;
    
      * Change handling of `--no-checksum`:
    
        * now that 'mirror create' uses stages, the mirror tests disable
          checksums when creating the mirror
    
        * remove `no_checksum` argument from library functions - this is now
          handled at the Spack-command-level (like for 'spack install')

    Adds four new sub-commands to the buildcache command:
    
    1. save-yaml: Takes a root spec and a list of dependent spec names,
    along with a directory in which to save yaml files, and writes out
    the full spec.yaml for each of the dependent specs.  This only needs
    to concretize the root spec once, then indexes it with the names of
    the dependent specs.
    
    2. check: Checks a spec (via either an abstract spec or via a full
    spec.yaml) against remote mirror to see if it needs to be rebuilt.
    Comparies full_hash stored on remote mirror with full_hash computed
    locally to determine whether spec needs to be rebuilt.  Can also
    generate list of specs to check against remote mirror by expanding
    the set of release specs expressed in etc/spack/defaults/release.yaml.
    
    3. get-buildcache-name: Makes it possible to attempt to read directly
    the spec.yaml file on a remote or local mirror by providing the path
    where the file should live based on concretizing the spec.
    
    4. download: Downloads all buildcache files associated with a spec
    on a remote mirror, including any .spack, .spec, and .cdashid files
    that might exist.  Puts the files into the local path provided on
    the command line, and organizes them in the same hierarchy found on
    the remote mirror
    
    This commit also refactors lib/spack/spack/util/web.py to expose
    functionality allowing other modules to read data from a url.

12,21,Friday,2018,3,"    repo: refactor indexes to be more extensible
    
    - virtual provider cache and tags were previously generated by nearly
      identical but separate methods.
    
    - factor out an Indexer interface for updating repository caches, and
      provide implementations for each type of index (TagIndex,
      ProviderIndex) so that more can be added if needed.
    
    - Among other things, this allows all indexes to be updated at once.
      This is an advantage because loading package files is the real
      overhead, and building the indexes once the packages are loaded is
      trivial. We avoid extra bulk read-ins by generating all package indexes
      at once.

12,22,Saturday,2018,2,"    patches: add a per-repository patch index
    
    - this fixes a bug where if we save a concretized sug-DAG where a package
      had been patched by a dependent, and the dependent was not in the DAG,
      we would not read in all patches correctly.
    
    - Rather than looking up patches in the DAG, we look them up globally
      from an index created from the entire repository.
    
    - The patch cache is a bit tricky for several reasons:
    
      - we have to cache information from packages, specifically, the patch
        level and working directory.
    
      - FilePatches need to know which package owns them, so that they can
        figure out where the patch lives.  The repo can change locations from
        run to run, so we have to store relative paths and restore them when
        the cache is reloaded.
    
      - Patch files can change underneath the cache, because repo indexes
        only update on package changes.  We currently punt on this -- there
        are stub methods for needs_update() that will need to check patch
        files when packages are loaded.  There isn't an easy way to do this
        at global indexing time without making the FastPackageChecker a lot
        slower.  This is TBD for a future commit.
    
      - Currently, the same patch can only be used one way in a package. That
        is, if it appears twice with different level/working_dir settings,
        bad things will happen.  There's no package that current uses the
        same patch two different ways, so we've punted on this as well, but
        we may need to fix this in the future by moving a lot of the metdata
        (level, working dir) to the spec, and *only* caching sha256sums in
        the PatchCache.  That would require some much more complicated tweaks
        to the Spec, so we're holding off on that til later.
    
    - This required patches to be refactored somewhat -- the difference
      between a UrlPatch and a FilePatch is still not particularly clean.

    This PR improves the validation of `modules.yaml` by introducing a custom validator that checks if an attribute listed in `properties` or `patternProperties` is a valid spec. This new check applied to the test case in #9857 gives:
    
    ```console
    $ spack install szip
    ==> Error: /home/mculpo/.spack/linux/modules.yaml:5: ""^python@2.7@"" is an invalid spec [Invalid version specifier]
    ```
    
    Details:
    * Moved the set-up of a custom validator class to spack.schema
      * In Spack we use `jsonschema` to validate configuration files
        against a schema. We also need custom validators to enforce
        writing default values within ""properties"" or ""patternProperties""
        attributes.
    
      * Currently, validators were customized at the place of use and with the
        recent introduction of environments that meant we were setting-up and
        using 2 different validator classes in two different modules.
    
      * This commit moves the set-up of a custom validator class in the
        `spack.schema` module and refactors the code in `spack.config` and
        `spack.environments` to use it.
    
    * Added a custom validator to check if an attribute is a valid spec
      * Added a custom validator that can be used on objects, which yields an
        error if the attribute is not a valid spec.
    
    * Updated the schema for modules.yaml
    
    * Updated modules.yaml to fix a few inconsistencies:
      - a few attributes were not tested properly using 'anyOf'
      - suffixes has been updated to also check that the attribute is a spec
      - hierarchical_scheme has been updated to hierarchy

    This enforces conventions that allow for correct handling of
    multi-valued variants where specifying no value is an option,
    and adds convenience functionality for specifying multi-valued
    variants with conflicting sets of values. This also adds a notion
    of ""feature values"" for variants, which are those that are understood
    by the build system (e.g. those that would appear as configure
    options). In more detail:
    
    * Add documentation on variants to the packaging guide
    * Forbid usage of '' or None as a possible variant value, in
      particular as a default. To indicate choosing no value, the user
      must explicitly define an option like 'none'. Without this,
      multi-valued variants with default set to None were not parsable
      from the command line (Fixes #6314)
    * Add ""disjoint_sets"" function to support the declaration of
      multi-valued variants with conflicting sets of options. For example
      a variant ""foo"" with possible values ""a"", ""b"", and ""c"" where ""c""
      is exclusive of the other values (""foo=a,b"" and ""foo=c"" are
      valid but ""foo=a,c"" is not).
    * Add ""any_combination_of"" function to support the declaration of
      multi-valued variants where it is valid to choose none of the
      values. This automatically defines ""none"" as an option (exclusive
      with all other choices); this value does not appear when iterating
      over the variant's values, for example in ""with_or_without"" (which
      constructs autotools option strings from variant values).
    * The ""disjoint_sets"" and ""any_combination_of"" methods return an
      object which tracks the possible values. It is also possible to
      indicate that some of these values do not correspond to options
      understood by the package's build system, such that methods like
      ""with_or_without"" will not define options for those values (this
      occurs automatically for ""none"")

    Allow customizing views with Spec-formatted directory structure
    
    Allow views to specify projections that are more complicated than
    merging every package into a single shared prefix. This will allow
    sites to configure a view for the way they want to present packages
    to their users; for example this can be used to create a prefix for
    each package but omit the DAG hash from the path.
    
    This includes a new YAML format file for specifying the simplified
    prefix for a spec in a view. This configuration allows the use of
    different prefix formats for different specs (i.e. specs depending
    on MPI can include the MPI implementation in the prefix).
    Documentation on usage of the view projection configuration is
    included.
    
    Depending on the projection configuration, paths are not guaranteed
    to be unique and it may not be possible to add multiple installs of
    a package to a view.

1,13,Sunday,2019,3,"    bugfix/gdk-pixbuf (#10312)
    
    * docbook processing works correctly for gdk-pixbuf
    
    1. The various bits of documentation in gdk-pixbuf include hardcoded
       references to dtd's and stuff at their canonical, Internet,
       locations.  BUT, gdk-pixbuf runs xslt-proc with the `--nonet`
       option, which forbids it from using the network.  Sadness ensues.
    
       Traditionally folks use XML Catalogs to map these to local copies.
       Our docbook-xsl package wasn't setting the appropriate env var in
       its dependents environments to use our catalog.
    
       Now it does.  Less sadness ensues.
    
    2. If we're going to use these things, we should depend on them.
    
    * Add gdk-pixbuf's bin to build environment
    
    The ""post-install.sh"" script uses gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders, which was
    installed earlier.
    
    If py-psyclone can set its own bin on its PATH, so can we...
    
    * Make gdk-pixbuf use recognizable docbook location
    
    Our docbook-xsl package assumes that the canonical location is
    `http://cdn.docbook.org/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl`, but
    the gdk-pixbuf's meson build script uses
    `http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/manpages/docbook.xsl`.
    
    This means that our XML Catalog doesn't fix the reference and sadness
    happens.
    
    Just patch the build that we see what we want to see, then we can make
    it all go away.

    CMake supports the notion of secondary generators which provide extra
    information to (e.g.) IDEs over and above that normally provided by
    the primary generator. Spack only supports the 'Unix Makefiles' and
    'Ninja' primary generators but was not parsing out the primary
    generator when a secondary generator was also included (e.g. for
    a generator attribute like 'Codeblocks - Ninja'). This adds a regex
    for extracting the primary generator for validation.
    
    Since the secondary generator is irrelevant to a Spack build, it is
    passed on to CMake without further validation.

    Closes #8070
    Closes #2645
    
    When searching for library directories (e.g. to add ""-L"" arguments to
    the compiler wrapper) Spack was only trying the ""lib/"" and ""lib64/""
    directories for each dependency install prefix; this missed cases
    where packages would install libraries to subdirectories and also was
    not customizable. This PR makes use of the "".headers"" and "".libs""
    properties for more-advanced location of header/library directories.
    Since packages can override the default behavior of "".headers"" and
    "".libs"", it also allows package writers to customize.

    for a package build have been removed:

    This restores the use of Package.headers when computing -I options
    for building a package that was added in #8136 and reverted in
    #10604. #8136 used utility logic that located all header files in
    an installation prefix, and calculated the -I options as the
    immediate roots containing those header files.
    
    In some cases, for a package containing a directory structure like
    
      prefix/
        include/
              ex1.h
              subdir/
                ex2.h
    
    dependents may expect to include ex2.h relative to 'include', and
    adding 'prefix/include/subdir' as a -I was causing errors,
    in particular if ex2.h has the same name as a system header.
    
    This updates header utility logic to by default return the base
    ""include"" directory when it exists, rather than subdirectories.
    It also makes it possible for package implementers to override
    Package.headers to return the subdirectory when it is required
    (for example with libxml2).

2,28,Thursday,2019,17,"    Added a sub-command to show if packages are relocatable (#9199)
    
    * Added the `spack buildcache preview` sub-command
    
    This is similar to `spack spec -I` but highlights which nodes in a DAG
    are relocatable and which are not.
    
    spec.tree has been generalized a little to accept a status function,
    instead of always showing the install status
    
    The current implementation works only for ELF, and needs to be
    generalized to other platforms.
    
    * Added a test to check if an executable is relocatable or not
    
    This test requires a few commands to be present in the environment.
    Currently it will run only under python 3.7 (which uses Xenial instead
    of Trusty).
    
    * Added tests for the 'buildcache preview' command.
    
    * Fixed codebase after rebase
    
    * Fixed the list of apt addons for Python 3.7 in travis.yaml

    * Rework of buildcache creation and install prefix checking using the functions introduced in
    https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/9199
    
    Instead of replacing rpaths with placeholder and then checking strings, make use of the functions
    relocate.is_recocatable and relocate.is_file_relocatable to decide if a package needs the allow-root option.
    
    This fixes a problem where the placeholder path was not in the first rpath entry. This was seen in c++ libraries and binaries because the compiler was outside the spack install base path and always appears first in the rpath.
    
    Instead of checking the first rpath entry, all rpaths have the placeholder path and the old install path (if it exists) replaced with the new install path.

4,2,Tuesday,2019,1,"    Added tests on compiler's version detection (#10931)
    
    * Split get_compiler_version into two functions:
      get_compiler_version_output runs the compiler with the relevant
      option to print the version; extract_version_from_output determines
      the version by examining this output. This makes it easier to test
      the customized version detection for each compiler. Users can
      customize this by overriding the following:
      * version_argument: this is the argument that tells the compiler to
        print its version. It assumes that the compiler will report its
            version if invoked with a single option (like ""--version"")
      * version_regex: the regular expression used to extract the version
        from the compiler argument. This assumes that a regular
            expression is sufficient to extract the version, and that the
            version can be extracted from a single capture group (Spack uses
            the first capture group)
      * default_version: allows you to completely override all version
        detection logic
      * get_compiler_version_output: if getting the compiler to report
        its version is more complex than invoking it with a single arg
      * extract_version_from_output: if it is difficult to define a regex
        that can be used to extract the version from the output
    * Added tests for version detection of most compilers

4,10,Wednesday,2019,3,"    Maintain a view for an environment (#10017)
    
    Environments are nowm by default, created with views.  When activated, if an environment includes a view, this view will be added to `PATH`, `CPATH`, and other shell variables to expose the Spack environment in the user's shell.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    spack env create e1 #by default this will maintain a view in the directory Spack maintains for the env
    spack env create e1 --with-view=/abs/path/to/anywhere
    spack env create e1 --without-view
    ```
    
    The `spack.yaml` manifest file now looks like this:
    
    ```
    spack:
      specs:
      - python
      view: true #or false, or a string
    ```
    
    These commands can be used to control the view configuration for the active environment, without hand-editing the `spack.yaml` file:
    
    ```
    spack env view enable
    spack env view envable /abs/path/to/anywhere
    spack env view disable
    ```
    
    Views are automatically updated when specs are installed to an environment. A view only maintains one copy of any package. An environment may refer to a package multiple times, in particular if it appears as a dependency. This PR establishes a prioritization for which environment specs are added to views: a spec has higher priority if it was concretized first. This does not necessarily exactly match the order in which specs were added, for example, given `X->Z` and `Y->Z'`:
    
    ```
    spack env activate e1
    spack add X
    spack install Y # immediately concretizes and installs Y and Z'
    spack install # concretizes X and Z
    ```
    
    In this case `Z'` will be favored over `Z`.
    
    Specs in the environment must be concrete and installed to be added to the view, so there is another minor ordering effect: by default the view maintained for the environment ignores file conflicts between packages. If packages are not installed in order, and there are file conflicts, then the version chosen depends on the order.
    
    Both ordering issues are avoided if `spack install`/`spack add` and `spack install <spec>` are not mixed.

4,18,Thursday,2019,2,"    improvements to our CDash reporter (#11168)
    
    * Make a separate CDash report for each package installed
    
    Previously, we generated a single CDash report (""build"") for the complete results
    of running a `spack install` command. Now we create a separate CDash build for
    each package that was installed.
    
    This commit also changes some of the tests related to CDash reporting.
    Now only one of the tests exercises the code path of uploading to a
    (nonexistent) CDash server. The rest of the related tests write their reports
    to disk without trying to upload them.
    
    * Don't report errors to CDash for successful packages
    
    Convert errors detected by our log scraper into warnings when the package
    being installed reports that it was successful.
    
    * Report a maximum of 50 errors/warnings to CDash
    
    This is in line with what CTest does. The idea is that if you have more than
    50 errors/warnings you probably aren't going to read through them all anyway.
    This change reduces the amount of data that we need to transfer and store.

4,19,Friday,2019,3,"    Fix outdated R packages failing to fetch (#11039)
    
    PR #10758 made a slight change to find_versions_of_archive() which included
    archive_url in the search process. While this fixed `spack create` and
    `spack checksum` missing command-line arguments, it caused `spack
    install` to prefer those URLs over those it found in the scrape process.
    
    As a result, the package url was treated as a list_url causing all R
    packages to stop fetching once the package was updated on CRAN.
    
    This patch is more selective about including the archive_url in the
    remote versions, explicitly overriding it with matching versions found
    by the scraper.

    Based on the LLVM documentation [1], Python is used to run the automated

    build without Python (~python), we limit it to a build time dependency.

    available as a spack package. This is because it is already included
    in llvm and llvm is difficult to configure using an external py-lit
    (several CMake variables to set correctly). Additionally, having
    py-lit as a spack dependency adds Python as a runtime dependency
    for llvm even though it is not required at runtime.

    Add fixes to support multiple installs and dependents using a subset

    * Update IntelPackage to only return scalapack libraries if the root
      spec depends on MPI: scalapack requires MPI to be mentioned as a
      dependency in the DAG. Package builds using intel-mkl for its
      blas/lapack implementations but not for scalapack were failing to
      build.
    
      Ideally it would be possible to ask if any of the packages in the
      DAG are actually requesting the scalapack functionality provided by
      the IntelPackage and only return scalapack libs in that case, but
      that is not easily done at this time.

    Use new `module` function instead of `get_module_cmd`
    
    Previously, Spack relied on either examining the bash `module()` function or using the `which` command to find the underlying executable for modules. More complicated module systems do not allow for the sort of simple analysis we were doing (see #6451).
    
    Spack now uses the `module` function directly and copies environment changes from the resulting subprocess back into Spack. This should provide a future-proof implementation for changes to the logic underlying the module system on various HPC systems.

    - `Package.make_jobs` attribute has been removed; `make_jobs` remains
      as a module-scope variable in the build environment.

      - move '-j'/'--jobs' argument into `spack.cmd.common.arguments`
    - Add unit tests to check that setting parallel jobs works as expected
      - add new test to ensure that build job setting is isolated to each build

    ""spack module tcl find -r <spec>"" (and equivalents for other module

    Spack instance. This updates the module index to handle locating
    module files for upstream Spack installations (encapsulating the
    logic in a new class called UpstreamModuleIndex); the updated index
    handles the case where a Spack installation has multiple upstream
    instances.
    
    Note that if a module is not available locally but we are using the
    local package, then we shouldn't use a module (i.e. if the package is
    also installed upstream, and there is a module file for it, Spack
    should not use that module). Likewise, if we are instance X using
    upstreams Y and Z like X->Y->Z, and if we are using a package from
    instance Y, then we should only use a module from instance Y. This
    commit includes tests to check that this is handled properly.

    For resources, it is desirable to use the expanded archive name of

    #11528 established 'spack-src' as the universal directory where

    placing a resource directory in the root staging area.
    
    This also:

      archive name (otherwise Spack will not be able to determine the
      original directory name when using a cached archive).

    * fmt: Add cxxstd variant, plus cmake/c++ patches
    
    Spack supported versions of fmt default to C++11 for versions
    less than 5, C++14 greater than 5, with fmt implementing
    fallbacks to whatever compiler supports.
    
    To give better ABI compatibility and use of newer standards, provide
    a `cxxstd` variant defaulting to 11 with 98-17 options. Use cmake_args
    to set CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD as appropriate, plus use of `FMT_USE_CPP11`
    option for C++98 builds. Use `conflicts` to disable use of certain
    standards in versions that don't support, or fail the build, with
    those standards.
    
    Add patches to unify use of `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` in 3.0 versions,
    remove hard-coding of compiler flags in `fmt-config.cmake`, and
    prevent use of C++11 features in 4.1.0 when in supported C++98
    mode.
    
    Default to not building documents as no dependency on Doxygen is
    yet present, and they are not part of the ""all"" build.

         optimizations and add these into the C++OPT=... statement.
      2. Drop spack support for configuring a 32-bit build on 64-bit
         hardware.

    - There is a missing dependency on libxmu when '+X' is set.
    - The libraries for R wind up in a non-standard location and are thus
      left out of the RPATH settings. This PR adds that directory to RPATH.
    - The MKL integer interface for gfortran is not in the BLAS libs. This
      PR replaces the intel interface with the gfortran interface if needed.

    Uninstalling dependents of a spec was relying on a traversal of the
    parents done by inspecting spec._dependents. This is in turn a
    DependencyMap that maps a package name to a single DependencySpec object
    (an edge in the DAG) and cannot thus model the case where a spec has
    multiple configurations of the same parent package installed (for
    example if different versions of the same Python library depend on
    the same Python installation).
    
    This commit works around this issue by constructing the list of specs to
    be uninstalled in an alternative way, and adds tests to verify the
    behavior. The core issue with DependencyMap is not resolved here.
