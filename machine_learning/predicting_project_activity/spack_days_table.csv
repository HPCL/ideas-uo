The user can\n    specify which libraries they need using variants (e.g. +iostreams to compile the\n    boost iostreams library). If no libraries are built then a header-only install\n    is performed (no compilation, just copy header files to prefix). The consequence\n    of this change is that packages which specify a dependency on boost may now fail\n    (until they are updated to specify exactly which boost libraries they need\n    compiled).\n    \n    The user may now specify whether to build shared libraries (static libraries are\n    always built) and whether to build libraries with/out multi-threading support\n    (default is to only build with multi-threading support).\n    \n    The executable on the user-config.jam toolset line is set to Spack's cc script.\n    Before, without this, the desired toolset was used but Spack deferred to the\n    boost build system to choose the compiler version.\n    \n    bzip2 and zlib are always specified as dependencies when iostreams is built\n    (before this could be controlled with the +compression variant).\n"", '    Fixed concretization\n', '    cmake : added variant that activates the build of the ncurses gui\n', '    added package : cgal\n', '    Correct Python version constraint syntax\n', '    Avoid key error when env var is unset\n']","[['a/var/spack/packages/petsc/package.py b/var/spack/packages/petsc/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/packages/patchelf/package.py b/var/spack/packages/patchelf/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/packages/szip/package.py b/var/spack/packages/szip/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/packages/boost/package.py b/var/spack/packages/boost/package.py'], ['a/lib/spack/spack/concretize.py b/lib/spack/spack/concretize.py', 'a/lib/spack/spack/spec.py b/lib/spack/spack/spec.py'], ['a/var/spack/packages/cmake/package.py b/var/spack/packages/cmake/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/packages/cgal/package.py b/var/spack/packages/cgal/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/packages/petsc/package.py b/var/spack/packages/petsc/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/packages/openssl/package.py b/var/spack/packages/openssl/package.py']]","[b'Todd Gamblin <tgamblin@llnl.gov>', b'Adam J.

This will configure it for use within Spack, using the\n           Spack wrapper.\n    \n        c) build: eg: ""make""\n    \n        d) install: eg: ""install""\n    \n    If one chooses to use StagedPackage instead of Package, then one must\n    implement each of the install sub-stages as a separate method.\n    StagedPackage.install() then calls each of the sub-stages as\n    appropriate.\n    \n    StagedPackage can be configured to only run certain sub-stages.  This\n    is done by setting the optional kwarg install_phases when calling\n    do_install().  Setting install_phases() ONLY has an effect on\n    StagedPackage, not on any existing packages.  By default,\n    install_phases is set to make StagedPackage run the same stages that\n    are normally run for any package: configure, build, install (and NOT\n    spconfig).\n    \n    The ability for Spack to run stages selectively for StagedPackage\n    instances will enable new functionality.  For example, explicit\n    CMake/Autotools helpers that allow Spack to help configure a user\'s\n    project without fetching, building or installing it.\n    \n    -------------\n    \n    One implementation of StagedPackage is provided, CMakePackage.  This\n    has the following advantage for CMake-based projects over using the\n    standard Package class:\n    \n      a) By separating out the phases, it enables future new functionality\n         for packages that use it.\n    \n      b) It provides an implementation of intall_spconfig(), which will\n         help users configure their CMake-based projects.\n    \n    CMakePackage expects users to implement configure_args() and\n    configure_env().  These methods provide the package-specific arguments\n    and environment needed to properly configure the package.  They are\n    placed in separated functions because they are used in both the\n    spconfig and configure stages.\n    \n    TODO:\n    \n    1. Generate spconfig.py scripts that are more readable.  This allows\n       the users to understand how their project is configured.\n    \n    2. Provide a practical way for the user to ACCESS the spconfig stage\n       without building the project through Spack.\n    \n    3. The CMAKE_TRANSITIVE_INCLUDE_PATH stuff needs to be reworked; it\n       should be considered provisional for now.\n    \n    4. User of Autotools might wish to make a similar ConfigurePackage\n       subclass of StagedPackage.\n    \n    ---------------\n    \n    One package using CMakePackage is introduced.

This breaks 'frontend' targets on the Cray platform but\n    all architecture targets, including the frontend, that are provided by\n    CrayPE are added to the Platform anyway so users can be explicit about\n    the architecture targeted by the Cray compiler wrappers:\n    \n    ```\n    spack spec libelf arch=cray-CNL-frontend\n    ```\n    \n    becomes\n    \n    ```\n    spack spec libelf arch=cray-CNL-mc8         # on an XK7 or\n    spack spec libelf arch=cray-CNL-sandybridge # on an older XC30, etc..\n    ```\n    \n    The only way the 'frontend' target can be defined after this commit is\n    through target environment variables.\n""]","[['a/lib/spack/spack/build_environment.py b/lib/spack/spack/build_environment.py'], ['a/lib/spack/docs/contribution_guide.rst b/lib/spack/docs/contribution_guide.rst'], ['a/lib/spack/spack/config.py b/lib/spack/spack/config.py']]","[b'Todd Gamblin <tgamblin@llnl.gov>', b'Todd Gamblin <tgamblin@llnl.gov>', b'Matt Belhorn <belhornmp@ornl.gov>']",305,

Fix #2807: Can\'t depend on virtual and non-virtual package\n    \n    - This is tested by test_my_dep_depends_on_provider_of_my_virtual_dep in\n      the concretize.py test.\n    \n    - This was actually working in the test suite, but it depended on the\n      order the dependencies were resolved in. Resolving non-virtual then\n      virtual worked, but virtual, then non-virtual did not.\n    \n    - Problem was that an unnecessary copy was made of a spec that already\n      had some dependencies set up, and the copy lost half of some of the\n      dependency relationships.  This caused the ""can\'d depend on X twice\n      error"".\n    \n    - Fix by eliminating unnecessary copy and ensuring that dep parameter of\n      _merge_dependency is always safe to own -- i.e. it\'s a defensive copy\n      from somewhere else.\n    \n    2. Fix bug and simplify concretization of deptypes.\n    \n    - deptypes weren\'t being accumulated; they were being set on each\n      DependencySpec. This could cause concretization to get into an infinite\n      loop.\n    \n    - Fixed by accumulating deptypes in DependencySpec.update_deptypes()\n    \n    - Also simplified deptype normalization logic: deptypes are now merged in\n      constrain() like everything else -- there is no need to merge them\n      specially or to look at dpeendents in _merge_dependency().\n    \n    - Add some docstrings to deptype tests.\n', '    make git fetching quite (#3180)\n    \n    also output repo and branch/commit/tag in one line\n', ""    Add url_for_version and depends_on('libiconv')  (#3555)\n    \n    * Add url_for_version and depends_on('libiconv')\n    \n    Fetching is broken.

Spack does not define PETSC_\n    ARCH, so Alquimia will not install.  This patch does two things\n    to fix the alquimia build:\n    \n    1. A patch has been added to remove the dependency on PETSC_ARCH.\n    \n    2. Alquimia currently depends on old versions of PETSc and pflotran.\n       @ghammond86 updated the alquimia interfaces to use more recent\n       versions, but his patch is still sitting in an alquimia pull\n       request.

It has problems.\n    \n    1. Rather than deal with the nasty sbang fooey in the\n       g-ir-tool-template.in derived scripts, it just adds a python\n       dependency to each package that runs one of the scripts.  This lets\n       the `/usr/bin/env python` sbang do the right thing.\n    \n    2. It stuffs a several directories on to the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment\n       variable, which is used for (among other things) locating the .gir\n       files.\n    \n    3. It avoids building the gtkplus demos because I can\'t make the bit\n       that calls `gdk-pixbuf-csource` work.  It doesn\'t think that it can\n       load `.png` files and all of the google hits I found suggest a bad\n       `loader.cache` file.  The file\'s fine and I can strace the command\n       and watch it read it in...  Many, many hours wasted here.\n    \n       In spite of the demo failing, the tests pass and an emacs built\n       with this lib seems to work.\n    \n    * Fix sbang so everyone needn\'t depend_on python\n    \n    Rather than have every package that\n    `depends_on(\'gobject-introspection\')` also need to\n    `depend_on(\'python\')`, this commit fixes the\n    scripts (e.g. `g-ir-scanner`).\n    \n    The interesting bit is in the gobject-introspection package.  There is\n    a beefy comment there that is included below.\n    \n    The commit also removes the now un-necessary dependencies from various\n    packages.\n    \n    I have two reservations about this commit:\n    \n    1. How portable is the ""insertion"" sed command?  I\'m particularly\n       worried that some sed\'s might need the line to insert to be on a\n       different line, which I can\'t imagine how to cram into the\n       Makefile.in.\n    \n       The solution I see to this is rather than extending the existing\n       sed command in the Makefile I could shim in another line in the\n       rule and e.g. call a bit of Perl (or Python, I suppose) which would\n       end up being much neater.\n    \n    2. As written it always uses Spack\'s `.../bin/sbang`, which might or\n       might not be a good idea.\n    \n       If I use ""the solution"" from number 1 above, then I can check the\n       line length before I munge it.

4,29,6,2017,7,53,"['    Python command, libraries, and headers (#3367)\n    \n    ## Motivation\n    \n    Python installations are both important and unfortunately inconsistent. Depending on the Python version, OS, and the strength of the Earth\'s magnetic field when it was installed, the name of the Python executable, directory containing its libraries, library names, and the directory containing its headers can vary drastically.\n    \n    I originally got into this mess with #3274, where I discovered that Boost could not be built with Python 3 because the executable is called `python3` and we were telling it to use `python`. I got deeper into this mess when I started hacking on #3140, where I discovered just how difficult it is to find the location and name of the Python libraries and headers.\n    \n    Currently, half of the packages that depend on Python and need to know this information jump through hoops to determine the correct information. The other half are hard-coded to use `python`, `spec[\'python\'].prefix.lib`, and `spec[\'python\'].prefix.include`. Obviously, none of these packages would work for Python 3, and there\'s no reason to duplicate the effort. The Python package itself should contain all of the information necessary to use it properly. This is in line with the recent work by @alalazo and @davydden with respect to `spec[\'blas\'].libs` and friends.\n    \n    ## Prefix\n    \n    For most packages in Spack, we assume that the installation directory is `spec[\'python\'].prefix`. This generally works for anything installed with Spack, but gets complicated when we include external packages. Python is a commonly used external package (it needs to be installed just to run Spack). If it was installed with Homebrew, `which python` would return `/usr/local/bin/python`, and most users would erroneously assume that `/usr/local` is the installation directory. If you peruse through #2173, you\'ll immediately see why this is not the case. Homebrew actually installs Python in `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.12_2` and symlinks the executable to `/usr/local/bin/python`. `PYTHONHOME` (and presumably most things that need to know where Python is installed) needs to be set to the actual installation directory, not `/usr/local`.\n    \n    Normally I would say, ""sounds like user error, make sure to use the real installation directory in your `packages.yaml`"". But I think we can make a special case for Python. That\'s what we decided in #2173 anyway. If we change our minds, I would be more than happy to simplify things.\n    \n    To solve this problem, I created a `spec[\'python\'].home` attribute that works the same way as `spec[\'python\'].prefix` but queries Python to figure out where it was actually installed. @tgamblin Is there any way to overwrite `spec[\'python\'].prefix`? I think it\'s currently immutable.\n    \n    ## Command\n    \n    In general, Python 2 comes with both `python` and `python2` commands, while Python 3 only comes with a `python3` command. But this is up to the OS developers. For example, `/usr/bin/python` on Gentoo is actually Python 3. Worse yet, if someone is using an externally installed Python, all 3 commands may exist in the same directory! Here\'s what I\'m thinking:\n    \n    If the spec is for Python 3, try searching for the `python3` command.\n    If the spec is for Python 2, try searching for the `python2` command.\n    If neither are found, try searching for the `python` command.\n    \n    ## Libraries\n    \n    Spack installs Python libraries in `spec[\'python\'].prefix.lib`. Except on openSUSE 13, where it installs to `spec[\'python\'].prefix.lib64` (see #2295 and #2253). On my CentOS 6 machine, the Python libraries are installed in `/usr/lib64`. Both need to work.\n    \n    The libraries themselves change name depending on OS and Python version. For Python 2.7 on macOS, I\'m seeing:\n    ```\n    lib/libpython2.7.dylib\n    ```\n    For Python 3.6 on CentOS 6, I\'m seeing:\n    ```\n    lib/libpython3.so\n    lib/libpython3.6m.so.1.0\n    lib/libpython3.6m.so -> lib/libpython3.6m.so.1.0\n    ```\n    Notice the `m` after the version number. Yeah, that\'s a thing.\n    \n    ## Headers\n    \n    In Python 2.7, I\'m seeing:\n    ```\n    include/python2.7/pyconfig.h\n    ```\n    In Python 3.6, I\'m seeing:\n    ```\n    include/python3.6m/pyconfig.h\n    ```\n    It looks like all Python 3 installations have this `m`. Tested with Python 3.2 and 3.6 on macOS and CentOS 6\n    \n    Spack has really nice support for libraries (`find_libraries` and `LibraryList`), but nothing for headers.

Previously, things like\n      `Executing phase 'configure'` would not be logged, only output to the\n      screen, so understanding phases in the build log was difficult.\n    \n    - The implementation of `log_output()` is different in two major ways:\n    \n      1. This implementation avoids race cases by using only one pipe (before\n         we had a multiprocessing pipe and a unix pipe).  The logger daemon\n         stops naturally when the input stream is closed, which avoids a race\n         in the previous implementation where we'd miss some lines of output\n         because the parent would shut the daemon down before it was done\n         with all output.\n    \n      2. Instead of turning output redirection on and off, which prevented\n         some things from being logged, this version uses control characters\n         in the output stream to enable/disable forced echoing.  We're using\n         the time-honored xon and xoff codes, which tell the daemon to echo\n         anything between them AND write it to the log.  This is how\n         `logger.force_echo()` works.\n    \n    - Fix places where output could get stuck in buffers by flushing more\n      aggressively.  This makes the output printed to the terminal the same\n      as that which would be printed through a pipe to `cat` or to a file.\n      Previously these could be weirdly different, and some output would be\n      missing when redirecting Spack to a file or pipe.\n    \n    - Simplify input and color handling in both `build_environment.fork()`\n      and `llnl.util.tty.log.log_output()`.  Neither requires an input_stream\n      parameter anymore; we assume stdin will be forwarded if possible.\n    \n    - remove `llnl.util.lang.duplicate_stream()` and remove associated\n      monkey-patching in tests, as these aren't needed if you just check\n      whether stdin is a tty and has a fileno attribute.\n"", '    Make SpackCommand a bit more testable\n    \n    - add fail_on_error argument\n    - record exception and return code when the command fails\n', '    Create, install and relocate tarballs of installed packages\n    \n    Adds the ""buildcache"" command to spack.

A user can retrieve\n    the archives from a mirror and verify their integrity using the\n    buildcache command. It is often the case that the user\'s Spack\n    instance is located in a different path compared to the Spack\n    instance used to generate the package archive and signature, so\n    this includes logic to relocate the RPATHs generated by Spack.\n', '    Decode process stream only for python3\n    \n    Popen.communicate outputs a str object for python2 and a bytes\n    object for python3.

Unit tests stressing module\n    file generation have been refactored accordingly.\n    \n    The module file generator for Lmod has been extended to multi-providers\n    and deeper hierarchies.\n    \n    * Improved the support for templates in module files.\n    \n    Added an entry in `config.yaml` (`template_dirs`) to list all the\n    directories where Spack could find templates for `jinja2`.\n    \n    Module file generators have a simple override mechanism to override\n    template selection ('modules.yaml' beats 'package.py' beats 'default').\n    \n    * Added jinja2 and MarkupSafe to vendored packages.\n    \n    * Spec.concretize() sets mutual spec-package references\n    \n    The correct place to set the mutual references between spec and package\n    objects at the end of concretization. After a call to concretize we\n    should now be ensured that spec is the same object as spec.package.spec.\n    \n    Code in `build_environment.py` that was performing the same operation\n    has been turned into an assertion to be defensive on the new behavior.\n    \n    * Improved code and data layout for modules and related tests.\n    \n    Common fixtures related to module file generation have been extracted\n    in `conftest.py`. All the mock configurations for module files have been\n    extracted from python code and have been put into their own yaml file.\n    \n    Added a `context_property` decorator for the template engine, to make\n    it easy to define dictionaries out of properties.\n    \n    The default for `verbose` in `modules.yaml` is now False instead of True.\n    \n    * Extendable module file contexts + short description from docstring\n    \n    The contexts that are used in conjunction with `jinja2` templates to\n    generate module files can now be extended from package.py and\n    modules.yaml.\n    \n    Module files generators now infer the short description from package.py\n    docstring (and as you may expect it's the first paragraph)\n    \n    * 'module refresh' regenerates all modules by default\n    \n    `module refresh` without `--module-type` specified tries to\n    regenerate all known module types. The same holds true for `module rm`\n    \n    Configure options used at build time are extracted and written into the\n    module files where possible.\n    \n    * Fixed python3 compatibility, tests for Lmod and Tcl.\n    \n    Added test for exceptional paths of execution when generating Lmod\n    module files.\n    \n    Fixed a few compatibility issues with python3.\n    \n    Fixed a bug in Tcl with naming_scheme and autoload + unit tests\n    \n    * Updated module file tutorial docs. Fixed a few typos in docstrings.\n    \n    The reference section for module files has been reorganized. The idea is\n    to have only three topics at the highest level:\n    \n      - shell support + spack load/unload use/unuse\n      - module file generation (a.k.a. APIs + modules.yaml)\n      - module file maintenance (spack module refresh/rm)\n    \n    Module file generation will cover the entries in modules.yaml\n    \n    Also:\n    \n      - Licenses have been updated to include NOTICE and extended to 2017\n      - docstrings have been reformatted according to Google style\n    \n    * Removed redundant arguments to RPackage and WafPackage.\n    \n    All the callbacks in `RPackage` and `WafPackage` that are not build\n    phases have been modified not to accept a `spec` and a `prefix`\n    argument. This permits to leverage the common `configure_args` signature\n    to insert by default the configuration arguments into the generated\n    module files. I think it's preferable to handling those packages\n    differently than `AutotoolsPackage`. Besides only one package seems\n    to override one of these methods.\n    \n    * Fixed broken indentation + improved resiliency of refresh\n    \n    Fixed broken indentation in `spack module refresh` (probably a rebase\n    gone silently wrong?). Filter the writers for blacklisted specs before\n    searching for name clashes. An error with a single writer will not\n    stop regeneration, but instead will print a warning and continue\n    the command.\n"", '    adios: fixed conditional dependencies on libevpath and dataspaces (#5392)\n    \n    fixes #5379\n']","[['a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/mesa/package.py b/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/mesa/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/hdf5/package.py b/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/hdf5/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/p7zip/package.py b/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/p7zip/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/py-quantities/package.py b/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/py-quantities/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/googletest/package.py b/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/googletest/package.py'], ['a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/targetp/package.py b/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/targetp/package.py'], ['a/.codecov.yml b/.codecov.yml', 'a/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml b/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml'], ['a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/adios/package.py b/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/adios/package.py']]","[b'Milton Woods <miltonjwoods@gmail.com>', b'Axel Huebl <axel.huebl@plasma.ninja>', b'sknigh <sknigh@sandia.gov>', b'healther <healther@users.noreply.github.com>', b'healther <healther@users.noreply.github.com>', b'Audrey Thoma <las_thoma15@iastate.edu>', b'Massimiliano Culpo <massimiliano.culpo@googlemail.com>', b'Massimiliano Culpo <massimiliano.culpo@googlemail.com>']",262,

9,23,6,2017,14,115,"['    Patches are hashed with specs, and can be associated with dependencies.\n    \n    - A package can depend on a special patched version of its dependencies.\n    \n      - The `Spec` YAML (and therefore the hash) now includes the sha256 of\n        the patch in the `Spec` YAML, which changes its hash.\n    \n      - The special patched version will be built separately from a ""vanilla""\n        version of the same package.\n    \n      - This allows packages to maintain patches on their dependencies\n        without affecting either the dependency package or its dependents.\n        This could previously be accomplished with special variants, but\n        having to add variants means the hash of the dependency changes\n        frequently when it really doesn\'t need to.  This commit allows the\n        hash to change *just* for dependencies that need patches.\n    \n      - Patching dependencies shouldn\'t be the common case, but some packages\n        (qmcpack, hpctoolkit, openspeedshop) do this kind of thing and it\n        makes the code structure mirror maintenance responsibilities.\n    \n    - Note that this commit means that adding or changing a patch on a\n      package will change its hash.  This is probably what *should* happen,\n      but we haven\'t done it so far.\n    \n      - Only applies to `patch()` directives; `package.py` files (and their\n        `patch()` functions) are not hashed, but we\'d like to do that in the\n        future.\n    \n    - The interface looks like this: `depends_on()` can optionally take a\n      patch directive or a list of them:\n    \n         depends_on(<spec>,\n                    patches=patch(..., when=<cond>),\n                    when=<cond>)\n         # or\n         depends_on(<spec>,\n                    patches=[patch(..., when=<cond>),\n                             patch(..., when=<cond>)],\n                    when=<cond>)\n    \n    - Previously, the `patch()` directive only took an `md5` parameter.  Now\n      it only takes a `sha256` parameter.  We restrict this because we want\n      to be consistent about which hash is used in the `Spec`.\n    \n    - A side effect of hashing patches is that *compressed* patches fetched\n      from URLs now need *two* checksums: one for the downloaded archive and\n      one for the content of the patch itself.

Not doing so is a security risk and leaves\n        users exposed to any arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities in\n        compression tools.\n', '    Consolidate some web-spidering commands in spack.util.web\n    \n    - move `spack.cmd.checksum.get_checksums` to `spack.util.web.spider_checksums`\n    \n    - move `spack.error.NoNetworkError` to `spack.util.web.NoNetworkError` since\n      it is only used there.\n', '    blas_lapack: add multithreading variant consistent in all implementations.

Many of the C functions in the MLL have been changed to to use `cgsize_t` instead of `int` in the arguments. These functions include any that may exceed the 2Gb limit of an` int`, e.g. zone dimensions, element data, boundary conditions, and connectivity.

When activated, if an environment includes a view, this view will be added to `PATH`, `CPATH`, and other shell variables to expose the Spack environment in the user's shell.\n    \n    Example:\n    \n    ```\n    spack env create e1 #by default this will maintain a view in the directory Spack maintains for the env\n    spack env create e1 --with-view=/abs/path/to/anywhere\n    spack env create e1 --without-view\n    ```\n    \n    The `spack.yaml` manifest file now looks like this:\n    \n    ```\n    spack:\n      specs:\n      - python\n      view: true #or false, or a string\n    ```\n    \n    These commands can be used to control the view configuration for the active environment, without hand-editing the `spack.yaml` file:\n    \n    ```\n    spack env view enable\n    spack env view envable /abs/path/to/anywhere\n    spack env view disable\n    ```\n    \n    Views are automatically updated when specs are installed to an environment. A view only maintains one copy of any package. An environment may refer to a package multiple times, in particular if it appears as a dependency. This PR establishes a prioritization for which environment specs are added to views: a spec has higher priority if it was concretized first. This does not necessarily exactly match the order in which specs were added, for example, given `X->Z` and `Y->Z'`:\n    \n    ```\n    spack env activate e1\n    spack add X\n    spack install Y # immediately concretizes and installs Y and Z'\n    spack install # concretizes X and Z\n    ```\n    \n    In this case `Z'` will be favored over `Z`.\n    \n    Specs in the environment must be concrete and installed to be added to the view, so there is another minor ordering effect: by default the view maintained for the environment ignores file conflicts between packages.
