This also adds a notion\\n    of \"feature values\" for variants, which are those that are understood\\n    by the build system (e.g. those that would appear as configure\\n    options). In more detail:\\n    \\n    * Add documentation on variants to the packaging guide\\n    * Forbid usage of \\'\\' or None as a possible variant value, in\\n      particular as a default. To indicate choosing no value, the user\\n      must explicitly define an option like \\'none\\'. Without this,\\n      multi-valued variants with default set to None were not parsable\\n      from the command line (Fixes #6314)\\n    * Add \"disjoint_sets\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants with conflicting sets of options. For example\\n      a variant \"foo\" with possible values \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" where \"c\"\\n      is exclusive of the other values (\"foo=a,b\" and \"foo=c\" are\\n      valid but \"foo=a,c\" is not).\\n    * Add \"any_combination_of\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants where it is valid to choose none of the\\n      values. This automatically defines \"none\" as an option (exclusive\\n      with all other choices); this value does not appear when iterating\\n      over the variant\\'s values, for example in \"with_or_without\" (which\\n      constructs autotools option strings from variant values).\\n    * The \"disjoint_sets\" and \"any_combination_of\" methods return an\\n      object which tracks the possible values. It is also possible to\\n      indicate that some of these values do not correspond to options\\n      understood by the package\\'s build system, such that methods like\\n      \"with_or_without\" will not define options for those values (this\\n      occurs automatically for \"none\")\\n    * Add documentation for usage of new functions for specifying\\n      multi-valued variants\\n'},\n",

This also adds a notion\\n    of \"feature values\" for variants, which are those that are understood\\n    by the build system (e.g. those that would appear as configure\\n    options). In more detail:\\n    \\n    * Add documentation on variants to the packaging guide\\n    * Forbid usage of \\'\\' or None as a possible variant value, in\\n      particular as a default. To indicate choosing no value, the user\\n      must explicitly define an option like \\'none\\'. Without this,\\n      multi-valued variants with default set to None were not parsable\\n      from the command line (Fixes #6314)\\n    * Add \"disjoint_sets\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants with conflicting sets of options. For example\\n      a variant \"foo\" with possible values \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" where \"c\"\\n      is exclusive of the other values (\"foo=a,b\" and \"foo=c\" are\\n      valid but \"foo=a,c\" is not).\\n    * Add \"any_combination_of\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants where it is valid to choose none of the\\n      values. This automatically defines \"none\" as an option (exclusive\\n      with all other choices); this value does not appear when iterating\\n      over the variant\\'s values, for example in \"with_or_without\" (which\\n      constructs autotools option strings from variant values).\\n    * The \"disjoint_sets\" and \"any_combination_of\" methods return an\\n      object which tracks the possible values. It is also possible to\\n      indicate that some of these values do not correspond to options\\n      understood by the package\\'s build system, such that methods like\\n      \"with_or_without\" will not define options for those values (this\\n      occurs automatically for \"none\")\\n    * Add documentation for usage of new functions for specifying\\n      multi-valued variants\\n'},\n",

Without this,\\n      multi-valued variants with default set to None were not parsable\\n      from the command line (Fixes #6314)\\n    * Add \"disjoint_sets\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants with conflicting sets of options. For example\\n      a variant \"foo\" with possible values \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" where \"c\"\\n      is exclusive of the other values (\"foo=a,b\" and \"foo=c\" are\\n      valid but \"foo=a,c\" is not).\\n    * Add \"any_combination_of\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants where it is valid to choose none of the\\n      values. This automatically defines \"none\" as an option (exclusive\\n      with all other choices); this value does not appear when iterating\\n      over the variant\\'s values, for example in \"with_or_without\" (which\\n      constructs autotools option strings from variant values).\\n    * The \"disjoint_sets\" and \"any_combination_of\" methods return an\\n      object which tracks the possible values. It is also possible to\\n      indicate that some of these values do not correspond to options\\n      understood by the package\\'s build system, such that methods like\\n      \"with_or_without\" will not define options for those values (this\\n      occurs automatically for \"none\")\\n    * Add documentation for usage of new functions for specifying\\n      multi-valued variants\\n'},\n",

This also adds a notion\\n    of \"feature values\" for variants, which are those that are understood\\n    by the build system (e.g. those that would appear as configure\\n    options). In more detail:\\n    \\n    * Add documentation on variants to the packaging guide\\n    * Forbid usage of \\'\\' or None as a possible variant value, in\\n      particular as a default. To indicate choosing no value, the user\\n      must explicitly define an option like \\'none\\'. Without this,\\n      multi-valued variants with default set to None were not parsable\\n      from the command line (Fixes #6314)\\n    * Add \"disjoint_sets\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants with conflicting sets of options. For example\\n      a variant \"foo\" with possible values \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" where \"c\"\\n      is exclusive of the other values (\"foo=a,b\" and \"foo=c\" are\\n      valid but \"foo=a,c\" is not).\\n    * Add \"any_combination_of\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants where it is valid to choose none of the\\n      values. This automatically defines \"none\" as an option (exclusive\\n      with all other choices); this value does not appear when iterating\\n      over the variant\\'s values, for example in \"with_or_without\" (which\\n      constructs autotools option strings from variant values).\\n    * The \"disjoint_sets\" and \"any_combination_of\" methods return an\\n      object which tracks the possible values. It is also possible to\\n      indicate that some of these values do not correspond to options\\n      understood by the package\\'s build system, such that methods like\\n      \"with_or_without\" will not define options for those values (this\\n      occurs automatically for \"none\")\\n    * Add documentation for usage of new functions for specifying\\n      multi-valued variants\\n'},\n",

This also adds a notion\\n    of \"feature values\" for variants, which are those that are understood\\n    by the build system (e.g. those that would appear as configure\\n    options). In more detail:\\n    \\n    * Add documentation on variants to the packaging guide\\n    * Forbid usage of \\'\\' or None as a possible variant value, in\\n      particular as a default. To indicate choosing no value, the user\\n      must explicitly define an option like \\'none\\'. Without this,\\n      multi-valued variants with default set to None were not parsable\\n      from the command line (Fixes #6314)\\n    * Add \"disjoint_sets\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants with conflicting sets of options. For example\\n      a variant \"foo\" with possible values \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" where \"c\"\\n      is exclusive of the other values (\"foo=a,b\" and \"foo=c\" are\\n      valid but \"foo=a,c\" is not).\\n    * Add \"any_combination_of\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants where it is valid to choose none of the\\n      values. This automatically defines \"none\" as an option (exclusive\\n      with all other choices); this value does not appear when iterating\\n      over the variant\\'s values, for example in \"with_or_without\" (which\\n      constructs autotools option strings from variant values).\\n    * The \"disjoint_sets\" and \"any_combination_of\" methods return an\\n      object which tracks the possible values. It is also possible to\\n      indicate that some of these values do not correspond to options\\n      understood by the package\\'s build system, such that methods like\\n      \"with_or_without\" will not define options for those values (this\\n      occurs automatically for \"none\")\\n    * Add documentation for usage of new functions for specifying\\n      multi-valued variants\\n'},\n",

This is in turn a\\n    DependencyMap that maps a package name to a single DependencySpec object\\n    (an edge in the DAG) and cannot thus model the case where a spec has\\n    multiple configurations of the same parent package installed (for\\n    example if different versions of the same Python library depend on\\n    the same Python installation).\\n    \\n    This commit works around this issue by constructing the list of specs to\\n    be uninstalled in an alternative way, and adds tests to verify the\\n    behavior.

Without this,\\n      multi-valued variants with default set to None were not parsable\\n      from the command line (Fixes #6314)\\n    * Add \"disjoint_sets\" function to support the declaration of\\n      multi-valued variants with conflicting sets of options.

It is also possible to\\n      indicate that some of these values do not correspond to options\\n      understood by the package\\'s build system, such that methods like\\n      \"with_or_without\" will not define options for those values (this\\n      occurs automatically for \"none\")\\n    * Add documentation for usage of new functions for specifying\\n      multi-valued variants\\n'},\n",

The repo can change locations from\\n        run to run, so we have to store relative paths and restore them when\\n        the cache is reloaded.\\n    \\n      - Patch files can change underneath the cache, because repo indexes\\n        only update on package changes.  We currently punt on this -- there\\n        are stub methods for needs_update() that will need to check patch\\n        files when packages are loaded.

There's no package that current uses the\\n        same patch two different ways, so we've punted on this as well, but\\n        we may need to fix this in the future by moving a lot of the metdata\\n        (level, working dir) to the spec, and *only* caching sha256sums in\\n        the PatchCache.  That would require some much more complicated tweaks\\n        to the Spec, so we're holding off on that til later.\\n    \\n    - This required patches to be refactored somewhat -- the difference\\n      between a UrlPatch and a FilePatch is still not particularly clean.\\n\"},\n",

So it\\'s only\\n      \"fast\" for parts of the code that *need* it.\\n    \\n    - This commit makes repositories instantiate the checker lazily, so it\\'s\\n      only constructed when needed.\\n'},\n",

I tried adding this and found that it\\n      caused some tests to break.\\n    \\n    - Instead of using only \"efficient\" regular expressions, Added a\\n      prefilter() class that allows the parser to quickly check a\\n      precondition before evaluating any of the expensive regexes.\\n    \\n    - Preconditions do things like check whether the string contains \"error\"\\n      or \"warning\" (linear time things) before evaluating regexes that would\\n      require them.  It\\'s sad that Python doesn\\'t use Thompson string\\n      matching (see https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html)\\n    \\n    - Even with Python\\'s slow implementation, this makes the parser ~200x\\n      faster on the input we tried it on.\\n    \\n    * Add `spack log-parse` command and improve the display of parsed logs\\n    \\n    - Add better coloring and line wrapping to the log parse output.  This\\n      makes nasty build output look better with the line numbers.\\n    \\n    - `spack log-parse` allows the log parsing logic used at the end of\\n      builds to be executed on arbitrary files, which is handy even outside\\n      of spack.\\n    \\n    - Also provides a profile option -- we can profile arbitrary files and\\n      show which regular expressions in the magic CTest parser take the most\\n      time.\\n    \\n    * Parallelize log parsing\\n    \\n    - Log parsing now uses multiple threads for long logs\\n    - Lines from logs are divided into chnks and farmed out to <ncpus>\\n    - Add -j option to `spack log-parse`\\n'},\n",

       "  'message': '    Patches are hashed with specs, and can be associated with dependencies.\\n    \\n    - A package can depend on a special patched version of its dependencies.\\n    \\n      - The `Spec` YAML (and therefore the hash) now includes the sha256 of\\n        the patch in the `Spec` YAML, which changes its hash.\\n    \\n      - The special patched version will be built separately from a \"vanilla\"\\n        version of the same package.\\n    \\n      - This allows packages to maintain patches on their dependencies\\n        without affecting either the dependency package or its dependents.\\n        This could previously be accomplished with special variants, but\\n        having to add variants means the hash of the dependency changes\\n        frequently when it really doesn\\'t need to.  This commit allows the\\n        hash to change *just* for dependencies that need patches.\\n    \\n      - Patching dependencies shouldn\\'t be the common case, but some packages\\n        (qmcpack, hpctoolkit, openspeedshop) do this kind of thing and it\\n        makes the code structure mirror maintenance responsibilities.\\n    \\n    - Note that this commit means that adding or changing a patch on a\\n      package will change its hash.  This is probably what *should* happen,\\n      but we haven\\'t done it so far.\\n    \\n      - Only applies to `patch()` directives; `package.py` files (and their\\n        `patch()` functions) are not hashed, but we\\'d like to do that in the\\n        future.\\n    \\n    - The interface looks like this: `depends_on()` can optionally take a\\n      patch directive or a list of them:\\n    \\n         depends_on(<spec>,\\n                    patches=patch(..., when=<cond>),\\n                    when=<cond>)\\n         # or\\n         depends_on(<spec>,\\n                    patches=[patch(..., when=<cond>),\\n                             patch(..., when=<cond>)],\\n                    when=<cond>)\\n    \\n    - Previously, the `patch()` directive only took an `md5` parameter.  Now\\n      it only takes a `sha256` parameter.  We restrict this because we want\\n      to be consistent about which hash is used in the `Spec`.\\n    \\n    - A side effect of hashing patches is that *compressed* patches fetched\\n      from URLs now need *two* checksums: one for the downloaded archive and\\n      one for the content of the patch itself.  Patches fetched uncompressed\\n      only need a checksum for the patch.  Rationale:\\n    \\n      - we include the content of the *patch* in the spec hash, as that is\\n        the checksum we can do consistently for patches included in Spack\\'s\\n        source and patches fetched remotely, both compressed and\\n        uncompressed.\\n    \\n      - we *still* need the patch of the downloaded archive, because we want\\n        to verify the download *before* handing it off to tar, unzip, or\\n        another decompressor.  Not doing so is a security risk and leaves\\n        users exposed to any arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities in\\n        compression tools.\\n'},\n",

Previously, things like\\n      `Executing phase 'configure'` would not be logged, only output to the\\n      screen, so understanding phases in the build log was difficult.\\n    \\n    - The implementation of `log_output()` is different in two major ways:\\n    \\n      1. This implementation avoids race cases by using only one pipe (before\\n         we had a multiprocessing pipe and a unix pipe).  The logger daemon\\n         stops naturally when the input stream is closed, which avoids a race\\n         in the previous implementation where we'd miss some lines of output\\n         because the parent would shut the daemon down before it was done\\n         with all output.\\n    \\n      2. Instead of turning output redirection on and off, which prevented\\n         some things from being logged, this version uses control characters\\n         in the output stream to enable/disable forced echoing.  We're using\\n         the time-honored xon and xoff codes, which tell the daemon to echo\\n         anything between them AND write it to the log.  This is how\\n         `logger.force_echo()` works.\\n    \\n    - Fix places where output could get stuck in buffers by flushing more\\n      aggressively.  This makes the output printed to the terminal the same\\n      as that which would be printed through a pipe to `cat` or to a file.\\n      Previously these could be weirdly different, and some output would be\\n      missing when redirecting Spack to a file or pipe.\\n    \\n    - Simplify input and color handling in both `build_environment.fork()`\\n      and `llnl.util.tty.log.log_output()`.  Neither requires an input_stream\\n      parameter anymore; we assume stdin will be forwarded if possible.\\n    \\n    - remove `llnl.util.lang.duplicate_stream()` and remove associated\\n      monkey-patching in tests, as these aren't needed if you just check\\n      whether stdin is a tty and has a fileno attribute.\\n\"},\n",

This isn't necessary in the\\n    `_cmp_key()`, and in fact we want more DAG structure than that to be\\n    included in the `_cmp_key()`.\\n    \\n    The new version constructs a tuple without copying the Spec DAG, and\\n    the tuple contains hashes of sub-DAGs that are computed recursively\\n    in-place.  This is way faster than the previous algorithm and reduces\\n    the numebr of copies significantly. It is also a correct DAG hash.\\n    \\n    Example timing and copy counts for the different hashing algorithms\\n    we've tried:\\n    \\n    Original (wrong) Spec hash:\\n    ```\\n    106,170 copies\\n    real    0m5.024s\\n    user    0m4.949s\\n    sys     0m0.104s\\n    ```\\n    \\n    Spec hash using YAML `dag_hash()`:\\n    ```\\n    3,794 copies\\n    real    0m5.024s\\n    user    0m4.949s\\n    sys     0m0.104s\\n    \\n    New no-copy, no-YAML hash:\\n    ```\\n    3,594 copies\\n    real    0m2.543s\\n    user    0m2.435s\\n    sys     0m0.104s\\n    ```\\n    \\n    So now we have a hash that is correct AND faster.\\n    \\n    The remaining ~3k copies happen mostly during concretization, and as\\n    all packages are initially loaded.  I believe this is because Spack\\n    currently has to load all packages to figure out virtual dependency\\n    information; it could also be becasue there ar a lot of lookups of\\n    partial specs in concretize.
