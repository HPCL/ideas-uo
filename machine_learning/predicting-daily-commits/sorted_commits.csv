    This changes the hash algorithm so that it does much less object
    allocation and copying, and so that it is correct.
    
    The old version of `_cmp_key()` would call `sorted_deps`, which would
    call `flat_dependencies` to get a list of dependencies so that it
    could sort them in alphabetical order.  This isn't necessary in the
    `_cmp_key()`, and in fact we want more DAG structure than that to be
    included in the `_cmp_key()`.
    
    The new version constructs a tuple without copying the Spec DAG, and
    the tuple contains hashes of sub-DAGs that are computed recursively
    in-place.  This is way faster than the previous algorithm and reduces
    the numebr of copies significantly. It is also a correct DAG hash.
    
    Example timing and copy counts for the different hashing algorithms
    we've tried:
    
    Original (wrong) Spec hash:
    ```
    106,170 copies
    real    0m5.024s
    user    0m4.949s
    sys     0m0.104s
    ```
    
    Spec hash using YAML `dag_hash()`:
    ```
    3,794 copies
    real    0m5.024s
    user    0m4.949s
    sys     0m0.104s
    
    New no-copy, no-YAML hash:
    ```
    3,594 copies
    real    0m2.543s
    user    0m2.435s
    sys     0m0.104s
    ```
    
    So now we have a hash that is correct AND faster.
    
    The remaining ~3k copies happen mostly during concretization, and as
    all packages are initially loaded.  I believe this is because Spack
    currently has to load all packages to figure out virtual dependency
    information; it could also be becasue there ar a lot of lookups of
    partial specs in concretize.  I can investigate this further.
